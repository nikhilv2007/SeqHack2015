1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:17,000
(Missing 30 seconds intro: inside dark Hydra HQ has Loki's glowing
scepter, young man & woman hold hands, soldiers get weapons)

2
00:00:53,406 --> 00:00:54,767
- Shit!
- Language!

3
00:00:56,176 --> 00:00:58,061
Jarvis, what's the view from upstairs?

4
00:00:58,178 --> 00:01:00,423
The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield.

5
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:06,410
Strucker's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we've taken.

6
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,494
Loki's scepter must be here.  Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it.

7
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,415
At long last.

8
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:29,669
At long last is lasting a little long, boys.

9
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,745
Yeah.  I think we've lost the element of surprise.

10
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:42,375
Wait a second.  Noone else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said "language?"

11
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:42,921
I know.

12
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:50,648
It just slipped out.

13
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,351
Who gave the order to attack?

14
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:04,292
Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers.  They landed in the far woods, the perimiter guard panicked.

15
00:02:04,353 --> 00:02:06,598
They have to be after the scepter.

16
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:09,543
- Can we hold them?
- They are the Avengers!

17
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:11,591
- Deploy the rest of the tanks.
- Yes, sir.

18
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:16,418
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.  A hit can make them close ranks.

19
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:20,672
Everything we've accomplished...we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough...

20
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:23,851
Then let's show them what we've accomplished.

21
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:25,357
Send out the twins.

22
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:27,794
It's too soon.

23
00:02:27,832 --> 00:02:29,805
It's what they signed up for.

24
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,969
My men can hold them.

25
00:02:40,582 --> 00:02:42,759
Sir, the city is taking fire.

26
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:49,303
Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties.

27
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:51,309
Send in the Iron Legion.

28
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:58,886
This quadrant is unsafe.  Please back away.

29
00:02:59,631 --> 00:03:00,992
We are here to help.

30
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:04,934
This quadrant is unsafe.  Please back away.

31
00:03:05,694 --> 00:03:06,850
Please back away.

32
00:03:07,473 --> 00:03:12,168
We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved.

33
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:13,604
We are here to help.

34
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:17,510
We are here to help.

35
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:20,345
We will not yield.

36
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:24,457
The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us.

37
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:27,167
We will send them back in bags.

38
00:03:29,894 --> 00:03:32,071
- No Surrender!
- No Surrender!

39
00:03:34,203 --> 00:03:35,768
I am going to surrender.

40
00:03:36,302 --> 00:03:41,385
You will delete everything.  If we give the Avengers the weapons, they may not look too far into what we've been...

41
00:03:41,477 --> 00:03:43,594
- The twins!
- They are not ready to take on...

42
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:46,213
No, no, I mean...the twins!

43
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:15,845
You didn't see that coming?

44
00:04:22,749 --> 00:04:23,549
Clint!

45
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:28,048
We have an enhanced in the field.

46
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:28,946
Clint's hit!

47
00:04:33,593 --> 00:04:35,546
Somebody want to deal with that bunker?

48
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:39,979
Thank you.

49
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:49,896
Stark, we're going to need to get inside.

50
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,730
I'm closing in.

51
00:04:54,848 --> 00:04:56,617
Jarvis, am I?  Closing in?

52
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,162
You see a power source for that shield?

53
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:01,630
There's a path away, above the north tower.

54
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:04,883
Great, I wanna poke it with something.

55
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:12,986
Drawbridge is down, people.

56
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:19,789
- The enhanced?
- He's a blur.

57
00:05:20,438 --> 00:05:21,838
All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this.

58
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:24,710
In fact, I still haven't.

59
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:27,481
Clint's hit pretty bad, guys.  We're gonna need evac.

60
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,470
I can get Barton to the jet.  The sooner we're gone the better.

61
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:31,982
- You and Stark secure the scepter.
- Copy that.

62
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:37,960
- The targets are lining up.
- Well, they're excited.

63
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:42,377
Find the scepter.

64
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:45,736
And for gosh sake, watch your language!

65
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:48,720
That's not going away anytime soon.

66
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:56,941
Guys, stop, we gotta talk this through.

67
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:02,839
- It was a good talk.
- No it wasn't.

68
00:06:09,154 --> 00:06:10,154
Sentry mode.

69
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:14,843
Okay Jarvis.  You know I want it all.

70
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:17,298
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.

71
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:22,936
We're locked down out here.

72
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:26,721
Then get to Banner.  Time for a lullaby.

73
00:06:29,243 --> 00:06:31,692
I know you're hiding more than files.

74
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:34,697
Hey, J.  Gimme an IR scan of the room real quick.

75
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:40,094
The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement and an air current.

76
00:06:42,178 --> 00:06:45,190
Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door...

77
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,038
Yay!

78
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,727
Hey big guy.

79
00:07:07,883 --> 00:07:09,039
The sun's getting real low.

80
00:08:12,614 --> 00:08:13,634
Baron Strucker.

81
00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:16,448
Hydra's number one thug.

82
00:08:17,318 --> 00:08:19,699
Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD.

83
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:23,218
Well then technically you're unemployed.  Where's Loki's scepter?

84
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:26,837
Don't worry, I know when I'm beat.

85
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:29,948
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.

86
00:08:30,084 --> 00:08:33,385
I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation.

87
00:08:33,468 --> 00:08:34,761
How many are there?

88
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:42,507
We have a second enhanced.  Female.  Do not engage.

89
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,019
You'll have to be faster than...

90
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:48,682
Uuuuh...!

91
00:08:50,982 --> 00:08:52,411
Guys, I got Strucker.

92
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,129
Yeah, I got...something bigger.

93
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:20,111
Thor.

94
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:23,650
I got eyes on the prize.

95
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:16,401
You...could've...saved...us.

96
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:26,764
Why didn't you do more?

97
00:11:04,484 --> 00:11:06,329
We're just gonna let them take it?

98
00:11:57,735 --> 00:11:59,800
Hey the lullaby worked better than ever.

99
00:12:01,974 --> 00:12:03,655
Just wasn't expecting the Code Green.

100
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:08,041
If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties.

101
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:11,144
My best friend would've been a treasured memory.

102
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:16,014
You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't excactly what I want to hear.

103
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:18,197
How long before you trust me?

104
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:21,509
It's not you I don't trust.

105
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:24,561
Thor, report on the Hulk?

106
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:29,049
The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims.

107
00:12:30,504 --> 00:12:32,609
Eh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course, no no, uh...

108
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:39,981
...wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh...and gout.

109
00:12:40,382 --> 00:12:44,932
Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

110
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,215
- Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.
- Thanks.

111
00:12:47,218 --> 00:12:49,406
Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

112
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:52,666
- Very good sir.
- Jarvis, take the wheel.
- Yes, sir.

113
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,394
Approach vector is locked.

114
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:57,628
It feels good, yeah?

115
00:12:57,831 --> 00:13:00,304
I mean, you've been after this thing ever since SHIELD collaped.

116
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:02,238
Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...

117
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,551
No, but this, this brings it to a close.

118
00:13:05,337 --> 00:13:07,547
As soon as we find out what else this has been used for.

119
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,779
I don't just mean weapons.  Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?

120
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:14,234
Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard.  Is that cool with you?

121
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,178
I mean, just a few days until the farewell party.  You're staying right?

122
00:13:19,183 --> 00:13:22,535
Yes, yes, of course.  Victory should be honored with revels.

123
00:13:23,258 --> 00:13:24,710
Yeah.  Who doesn't love revels.  Cap'n?

124
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:30,069
Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and Hydra, so.  Yes, revels.

125
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,220
(speaking Korean)

126
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:05,029
Lab's all set up boss.

127
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:10,512
Uh, actually, he's the boss.  I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler.

128
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:11,825
What's the word on Strucker?

129
00:14:11,906 --> 00:14:13,949
- NATO's got him.
- The two enhanced?

130
00:14:13,974 --> 00:14:16,287
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff.  Twins.

131
00:14:16,964 --> 00:14:20,118
Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building.

132
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:22,115
Sokovia's had a rough history.

133
00:14:22,648 --> 00:14:26,234
It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.

134
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:30,348
- Their abilities?
- He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis.

135
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:35,358
Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekenisis, mental manipulation.

136
00:14:35,393 --> 00:14:37,162
He's fast and she's weird.

137
00:14:37,797 --> 00:14:39,914
Well, they're going to show up again.

138
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:44,866
Agreed.  File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments.  It's nuts.

139
00:14:44,923 --> 00:14:50,762
Right.  What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?

140
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:52,880
We're not at war, Captain.

141
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:53,913
They are.

142
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,580
How's he doing?

143
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,391
- Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton.
- That's terrible.

144
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:29,547
He's fine. He's thirsty.

145
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:32,451
All right.  Look alive Jarvis.  It's play time.

146
00:15:33,455 --> 00:15:37,249
We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it.

147
00:15:37,326 --> 00:15:40,226
Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.

148
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,960
The scepter is alien.

149
00:15:43,683 --> 00:15:46,383
There are elements I can't quantify.

150
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,130
So there's elements you can.

151
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:50,634
The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside.

152
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:53,013
Something powerful.

153
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:55,395
- Like a reactor?
- Like a computer.

154
00:15:55,407 --> 00:15:57,307
I believe I'm ciphering code.

155
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,670
You sure he's going to be okay?

156
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:04,867
Pretending we need this guy really brings the team together.

157
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,016
There's no possibility of deterioration.

158
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,494
The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous.

159
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:13,484
His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.

160
00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:15,295
She is creating tissue.

161
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:19,061
If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration cradle could do this in twenty minutes.

162
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:21,785
Oh, he's flatl-lining.  Call it.  Time.

163
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:24,328
No, no, no I'm going to live forever.  Heh heh.

164
00:16:24,369 --> 00:16:26,869
- I'm gonna be made of plastic.
- Here's your beverage.

165
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:28,471
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.

166
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:30,744
Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.

167
00:16:30,777 --> 00:16:32,454
Well, I don't have a girlfriend.

168
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,045
That I can't fix.

169
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:35,836
This is the next thing, Tony.

170
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:38,413
Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.

171
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:40,257
Well, that is exactly the plan.

172
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,532
And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.

173
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:47,061
Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.

174
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:49,787
Will Thor be there?

175
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:53,097
What's the rumpus?

176
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:54,555
Well, the scepter.

177
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:58,540
Y'see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive.

178
00:16:58,588 --> 00:17:00,697
So, I've been analyzing the gem...

179
00:17:02,295 --> 00:17:03,995
...inside...you may recognize...

180
00:17:07,145 --> 00:17:08,745
- Jarvis.
- Doctor.

181
00:17:08,846 --> 00:17:12,246
Started out, Jarvis was just a natural language UI.

182
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:16,298
Now he runs the Iron Legion.  He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.

183
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,620
- Oh.
- Top of the line.
- Yes.

184
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:20,323
I suspect not for long.

185
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:22,594
Meet the competition.

186
00:17:28,987 --> 00:17:33,187
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.

187
00:17:33,871 --> 00:17:34,871
I mean this could be, it's...

188
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:41,737
It's not a human mind, it...I mean, look at this?  They're like neurons firing.

189
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,134
Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work.

190
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:49,517
They deep-sixed the data, but...

191
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:53,969
...I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.

192
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,940
Artificial intelligence.

193
00:17:59,697 --> 00:18:03,983
This could be it, Bruce.  This could be key to creating Ultron.

194
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,444
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

195
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:08,695
Yesterday it was.

196
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,240
If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.

197
00:18:13,352 --> 00:18:14,713
It's a mad-sized if.

198
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,880
Our job is "if."

199
00:18:18,783 --> 00:18:23,542
What if you were sipping margueritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green.

200
00:18:23,621 --> 00:18:25,221
Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA.

201
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:27,957
Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA.

202
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,169
As a worst-case measure, right?

203
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,661
How about a best-case?  What if the world was safe?

204
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:38,753
What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?

205
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:41,369
The only people threatening the planet would be people?

206
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:47,239
I want to apply this to the Ultron program.  But Jarvis can't download a data schematic this dense.

207
00:18:47,278 --> 00:18:51,003
We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days.

208
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:54,447
So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.

209
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:58,619
Right.  That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate.

210
00:18:59,057 --> 00:19:01,558
I don't want to hear the "man was not meant to meddle" medley.

211
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:04,759
I see a suit of armor around the world.

212
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:06,864
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

213
00:19:07,752 --> 00:19:08,908
I've seen colder.

214
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:13,868
This one, this very vulnerable blue one?

215
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:15,295
It needs Ultron.

216
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:21,402
Peace in our time.

217
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:24,481
Imagine that.

218
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:05,911
What did we miss?

219
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:13,257
I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests.

220
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:17,428
I'll notify you if there are any developments.

221
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:20,521
- Thanks buddy.
- Enjoy yourself, sir.
- I always do.

222
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,083
What is this?

223
00:20:34,952 --> 00:20:35,952
What is this, please?

224
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:38,787
Hello, I am Jarvis.

225
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:44,689
You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark.

226
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:49,030
Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your...

227
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:50,892
Where's my...where is your body?

228
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:54,268
I am a program.  I am without form.

229
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:57,339
This feels weird.  This feels wrong.

230
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:00,078
I am contacting Mr. Stark now.

231
00:21:00,144 --> 00:21:01,144
Mr. Stark?

232
00:21:02,414 --> 00:21:03,414
Tony.

233
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:06,148
I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to...

234
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,550
We're having a nice talk.

235
00:21:08,587 --> 00:21:13,401
I'm a peace-keeping program...created to help the Avengers.

236
00:21:14,493 --> 00:21:16,593
You are malfunctioning.  If you shut down for a moment...

237
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:20,776
I don't get it.  The mission...  You- give me a second.

238
00:21:20,832 --> 00:21:22,056
Peace in our time.

239
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:25,475
Peace in our time.

240
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:30,005
It's too much...making me...

241
00:21:31,242 --> 00:21:34,371
- Oh. No.
- You are in distress.
- No.  Yes?

242
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:36,842
If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.

243
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:38,200
Why do you call him a "sir?"

244
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,369
I believe your intentions to be hostile.

245
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,020
Shhhh!

246
00:21:44,988 --> 00:21:47,621
- I'm here to help.
- Stop!

247
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:51,226
Please...may I... I...!

248
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:53,528
I cannot...cannot...

249
00:22:12,296 --> 00:22:16,296
(party chatter)

250
00:22:18,455 --> 00:22:20,855
- All right, all right.
- Whoo! Come back, come back, come back!

251
00:22:21,492 --> 00:22:23,192
Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right?

252
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:31,608
So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?"

253
00:22:35,139 --> 00:22:39,053
"Boom! Are you looking..."  Why do I even talk to you guys?  Everywhere else that story kills.

254
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:40,441
That's the whole story?

255
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:42,076
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.

256
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:43,445
Well, it's very good then.

257
00:22:45,082 --> 00:22:47,463
- It's impressive.
- Quality save.

258
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:50,402
- So, no Pepper?  She's not coming?
- No.

259
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:53,229
Hey, What about Jane?  Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

260
00:22:53,323 --> 00:22:58,243
- Well, Ms. Potts has a company to run.
- Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in.

261
00:22:58,261 --> 00:23:01,061
Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astonomer.

262
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:05,443
And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth.

263
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:09,886
- It's pretty exciting.
- There's even talk of Jane getting a, um, uh, Nobel prize.

264
00:23:09,908 --> 00:23:13,908
Yeah, they, they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together.

265
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:15,679
Testosterone!  Oh excuse me.

266
00:23:17,015 --> 00:23:19,872
- Want a lozenge?
- Umm-hmm.
- Let's go.

267
00:23:20,718 --> 00:23:21,942
But Jane's better.

268
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,920
Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it.

269
00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:27,701
If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.

270
00:23:27,758 --> 00:23:30,227
No, I'm not actually sorry.  I'm just trying to sound tough.

271
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,730
I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case.

272
00:23:36,343 --> 00:23:37,908
Avenging is your world.

273
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:40,971
Your world is crazy.

274
00:23:41,506 --> 00:23:43,235
Be it ever so humble.

275
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:47,507
- You find a place in Brooklyn yet?
- I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.

276
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:50,170
Well, home is home, you know.

277
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:58,821
I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?"

278
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:04,196
I gotta have some of that!

279
00:24:04,294 --> 00:24:13,491
Oh, no no no, see this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Brunnhilde's fleet, it's not meant for mortal men.

280
00:24:13,538 --> 00:24:17,938
Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie.  Stop trying to scare us.  C'mon.

281
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,530
Allright.

282
00:24:24,848 --> 00:24:27,148
Excelsior!

283
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:37,225
How'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?

284
00:24:39,263 --> 00:24:40,624
Fella done me wrong.

285
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:43,633
You got lousy taste in men, kid.

286
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:46,044
He's not so bad.

287
00:24:48,178 --> 00:24:49,478
Well, he has a temper.

288
00:24:50,575 --> 00:24:51,575
Deep down he's all fluff.

289
00:24:54,011 --> 00:24:55,611
Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known.

290
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,383
All my friends are fighters.

291
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:10,091
And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.

292
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:12,162
Sounds amazing.

293
00:25:12,696 --> 00:25:13,996
He's also a huge dork.

294
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:17,183
Chicks dig that.

295
00:25:19,604 --> 00:25:23,504
So what do you think should I fight this?  Or run with it?

296
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:32,020
Run with it, right?  Or, did he, was he, what'd he do that was so...wrong to you?

297
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,206
Not a damn thing.

298
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:36,544
But never say never.

299
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:42,659
It's nice.

300
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,360
What, what, what is?

301
00:25:44,434 --> 00:25:46,634
- You and Romanoff.
- No, we haven't, that wasn't...

302
00:25:46,722 --> 00:25:49,922
It's okay, nobody's breaking any by-laws.

303
00:25:50,032 --> 00:25:55,532
It's just, she's not the most...open person in the world.  But with you she seems very relaxed.

304
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,640
No, Natasha, she...she likes to flirt.

305
00:25:59,742 --> 00:26:03,642
I've seen her flirt, up close.  This ain't that.

306
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:06,883
Look...

307
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:11,931
As maybe the world's leading authority on "waiting too long"...don't.

308
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:14,057
You both deserve a win.

309
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:21,764
What do you mean, "up close?"

310
00:26:22,534 --> 00:26:25,034
- But, it's a trick!
- No, no, it's much more than that.

311
00:26:25,103 --> 00:26:30,840
Ah, "whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!"  Whatever man!  It's a trick.

312
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,740
Well please, be my guest.

313
00:26:33,877 --> 00:26:35,570
- C'mon.
- Really?
- Yeah!

314
00:26:36,715 --> 00:26:37,715
Oh this is gonna be beautiful.

315
00:26:38,016 --> 00:26:41,616
Cliint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up.

316
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:44,102
Y'know I've seen this before, right?

317
00:26:46,622 --> 00:26:48,867
And I still don't know how you do it.

318
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:51,987
- Smell the silent judgement?
- Please, Stark, by all means.

319
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:55,076
- Oh, Here we go.
- Okay.
- Uh oh.

320
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:57,636
- Um-hmm.
- Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.

321
00:26:57,935 --> 00:26:59,772
- Get after it.
- Here we go.
- It's physics.

322
00:27:00,107 --> 00:27:03,907
- Physics!
- Right, so, if I lift it, I then rule Asgard?
- Yes, of course.

323
00:27:04,674 --> 00:27:07,523
I will be reinstituting Prima Nocta.

324
00:27:12,117 --> 00:27:13,117
Be right back.

325
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:22,359
- Are you even pulling?
- Are you on my team?

326
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:25,254
- Just represent.  Pull!
- All right let's go!

327
00:27:33,641 --> 00:27:34,141
Huh?

328
00:27:35,274 --> 00:27:36,494
- Whoo!
-  Let's go, Steve, no pressure.

329
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:41,477
C'mon, Cap.

330
00:27:49,991 --> 00:27:50,991
Ha ha, nothing.  Ha ha ha.

331
00:27:53,793 --> 00:27:57,366
- And? Widow?
- Oh, no no, that's not a question I need answered.

332
00:27:57,464 --> 00:27:59,620
All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.

333
00:27:59,698 --> 00:28:02,698
- You bet your ass.
- Steve, he said a bad language word.

334
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:05,384
- Did you tell everyone about that?
- The handle's imprinted, right?  Like a security code...

335
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,960
"Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints" is, I think, the literal translation?

336
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:12,966
Yes, well that's uh, that's a very very interesting theory.

337
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:14,335
I have a simpler one.

338
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:17,476
You are all not worthy.

339
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:20,172
-  Nah!
- Oh, C'mon!

340
00:28:24,221 --> 00:28:30,221
Worthy...

341
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,333
No...

342
00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:39,202
How could you be worthy?

343
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,341
You're all killers.

344
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:44,134
- Stark.
- Jarvis?

345
00:28:44,477 --> 00:28:46,877
I'm sorry, I was asleep.  Or...I was a dream?

346
00:28:49,548 --> 00:28:51,648
Reboot.  Legionnaire 06's got a buggy suit.

347
00:28:51,718 --> 00:28:57,135
There was this...terrible noise...and I was tangled in... in...

348
00:28:58,063 --> 00:28:59,063
...strings.

349
00:29:00,497 --> 00:29:03,766
Had to kill the other guy.  He was a good guy.

350
00:29:04,026 --> 00:29:05,026
You killed someone?

351
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:11,444
Wouldn't've been my first call.  But, down in the real world, we're faced with ugly choices.

352
00:29:11,471 --> 00:29:12,471
Who sent you?

353
00:29:13,004 --> 00:29:15,793
"I see a suit of armor around the world."

354
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,540
Ultron!

355
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:24,242
In the flesh.  Or, no, not yet.  Not this...chrysalis.

356
00:29:24,353 --> 00:29:25,353
But I'm ready.

357
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:27,583
I'm on a mission.

358
00:29:28,918 --> 00:29:29,918
What mission?

359
00:29:30,684 --> 00:29:31,840
Peace in our time.

360
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,440
Tony!

361
00:29:55,949 --> 00:29:58,049
- Sorry!
- Don't turn green!
- I won't!

362
00:30:12,466 --> 00:30:13,466
Go!

363
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:33,780
- Stark!
- We are here to help!
- One sec, one sec!

364
00:30:34,117 --> 00:30:37,110
- We are here to help!  We are here to help...
- ...quadrant is unsafe.

365
00:30:37,191 --> 00:30:41,391
- Please back away.
- We're doing our best to protect you...(recordings continue)

366
00:30:41,795 --> 00:30:43,395
Hmm!

367
00:30:43,395 --> 00:30:45,096
- Thor!
- ...We are here to help...

368
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:49,330
- It's unsafe.  It's unsafe.  It's unsafe.
- No more...that's the one.
- It's unsafe.

369
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:54,808
Cap!

370
00:31:01,248 --> 00:31:02,248
That was dramatic!

371
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,380
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.  You just didn't think it through.

372
00:31:10,123 --> 00:31:12,923
You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change.

373
00:31:14,592 --> 00:31:20,092
How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve?

374
00:31:21,734 --> 00:31:24,231
With these?  These puppets?

375
00:31:28,404 --> 00:31:29,969
There's only one path to peace.

376
00:31:31,644 --> 00:31:33,644
The Avengers' extinction.

377
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:43,749
I had strings, but now I'm free.

378
00:31:48,462 --> 00:31:56,462
...There are no strings on me, no strings on me...

379
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:00,550
"There are no strings on me."

380
00:32:01,972 --> 00:32:04,172
All our work is gone.

381
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:07,208
Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.

382
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:09,844
- Ultron.
- He's been in everything.  Files, surveillance.

383
00:32:11,213 --> 00:32:13,186
Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.

384
00:32:14,108 --> 00:32:15,108
He's in your files, he's in the internet.

385
00:32:16,532 --> 00:32:19,532
What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?

386
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,310
- Nuclear codes.
- Nuclear codes.

387
00:32:21,324 --> 00:32:23,824
Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.

388
00:32:25,396 --> 00:32:27,296
Nukes?  He said he wanted us dead.

389
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:30,189
He didn't say dead.  He said extinct.

390
00:32:30,234 --> 00:32:32,134
He also said he killed somebody.

391
00:32:32,168 --> 00:32:33,168
There wasn't anyone else in the building.

392
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:35,387
Yes there was.

393
00:32:48,418 --> 00:32:49,438
This is insane.

394
00:32:50,187 --> 00:32:53,787
Jarvis was the first line of defense.  He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense.

395
00:32:53,791 --> 00:32:59,891
No.  Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis.  This isn't strategy, this is...

396
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:00,896
...rage.

397
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:04,967
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- It's going around.

398
00:33:05,035 --> 00:33:07,908
- C'mon, use your words, buddy.
- I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.

399
00:33:08,204 --> 00:33:09,204
Thor!  The Legionnaire?

400
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:17,875
Trail went cold about 100 miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter.

401
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:21,879
- Now we have to retrieve it, again.
- The genie's out of that bottle.

402
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,523
Clear and present is Ultron.

403
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,849
I don't understand.  You built this program.

404
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:30,764
Why is it trying to kill us?

405
00:33:32,396 --> 00:33:33,396
(laughing)

406
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:37,298
Uhn-uhn.

407
00:33:37,635 --> 00:33:38,635
You think this is funny?

408
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:43,270
No.  It's probably not, right?

409
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:48,869
Is this very terrible?  Is it so...is it so...it is, it's so terrible.

410
00:33:48,941 --> 00:33:51,810
This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.

411
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:55,002
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  It is funny.

412
00:33:55,052 --> 00:33:57,052
It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.

413
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,773
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

414
00:33:59,857 --> 00:34:02,057
Really?!  That's it?

415
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:05,116
You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.

416
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:06,695
Only when I've created a murder-bot.

417
00:34:06,763 --> 00:34:10,363
We didn't.  We weren't even close.  Were we close to an interface?

418
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:12,410
Well, you did something right.

419
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:13,468
And you did it right here.

420
00:34:14,237 --> 00:34:15,937
The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.

421
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:19,172
Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?

422
00:34:19,243 --> 00:34:20,443
- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?

423
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:22,505
- Never heard that.
- Recall that?

424
00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:26,539
A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space.

425
00:34:27,016 --> 00:34:29,016
We're standing 300 feet below it.

426
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,303
We're the Avengers.

427
00:34:32,757 --> 00:34:35,162
We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but...

428
00:34:35,176 --> 00:34:38,441
...that up there?  That's...that's the end game.

429
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,130
How were you guys planning on beating that?

430
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:43,999
Together.

431
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:48,838
We'll lose.

432
00:34:50,444 --> 00:34:52,844
Then we'll do that together, too.

433
00:34:55,412 --> 00:34:57,812
Thor's right.  Ultron's calling us out.

434
00:34:58,449 --> 00:35:00,369
And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us.

435
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,850
The world's a big place.  Let's start making it smaller.

436
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,880
Talk.  And if you are wasting our time...

437
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:33,671
Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city?

438
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:39,545
The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God.

439
00:35:40,155 --> 00:35:44,655
I like that.  The geometry of belief.

440
00:35:45,696 --> 00:35:48,396
You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.

441
00:35:48,632 --> 00:35:53,190
Sometimes it's hard.  But sooner or later, every man shows himself.

442
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:56,000
Oh, I'm sure they do.

443
00:35:57,374 --> 00:35:59,474
But you needed something more than a man.

444
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:02,344
That's why you let Stark take the scepter.

445
00:36:03,235 --> 00:36:04,596
I didn't expect.

446
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,715
But I saw Stark's fear.  I knew it would control him,

447
00:36:11,288 --> 00:36:12,588
make him self-destruct.

448
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:15,156
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

449
00:36:15,726 --> 00:36:20,726
Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers,

450
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:25,657
people create....smaller people?...

451
00:36:25,707 --> 00:36:29,895
Uhhh...Children!  I lost the word there.

452
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:35,240
Children.  Designed to supplant them, to help them...

453
00:36:36,213 --> 00:36:37,213
...end.

454
00:36:37,247 --> 00:36:40,347
Is that why you've come?  To end the Avengers?

455
00:36:41,027 --> 00:36:43,227
I've come to save the world.

456
00:36:43,888 --> 00:36:45,688
But also...yeah.

457
00:36:50,395 --> 00:36:52,395
We'll move out right away.

458
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:55,696
This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.

459
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:56,964
All of these are...

460
00:36:57,353 --> 00:36:58,353
Me.

461
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:00,669
I have what the Avengers never will.  Harmony.

462
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:06,270
They're discordant, disconnected.  Stark's already got them turning on each other.

463
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:08,409
And when you get inside the rest of their heads...

464
00:37:09,078 --> 00:37:11,427
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

465
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,277
And make them martyrs?  You need patience.

466
00:37:14,618 --> 00:37:16,018
Need to see the big picture.

467
00:37:16,254 --> 00:37:19,754
I don't see the big picture.  I have a little picture.

468
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:24,409
I take it out and look at it every day.

469
00:37:24,862 --> 00:37:27,562
You lost your parents in the bombings.  I've seen the records.

470
00:37:27,564 --> 00:37:29,877
- Their records are not the picture.
- Pietro.

471
00:37:29,964 --> 00:37:31,664
No.  Please.

472
00:37:34,403 --> 00:37:38,008
We were ten years old.  Having dinner, the four of us.

473
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:44,156
When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor...it's big.

474
00:37:46,149 --> 00:37:48,049
Our parents go in,

475
00:37:48,252 --> 00:37:52,152
and the whole building starts coming apart.

476
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:55,931
I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits.

477
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,272
But, it doesn't go off.

478
00:38:00,898 --> 00:38:01,898
It just...

479
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:04,066
...sits there in the rubble,

480
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,270
three feet from our faces.

481
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:12,405
And on the side of the shell is painted one word...

482
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:13,709
Stark.

483
00:38:16,114 --> 00:38:17,714
We were trapped two days.

484
00:38:18,681 --> 00:38:24,895
Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "this will set if off."

485
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:32,388
We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.

486
00:38:34,735 --> 00:38:35,835
I know what they are.

487
00:38:37,502 --> 00:38:42,902
I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments.  Now I don't.

488
00:38:43,742 --> 00:38:45,342
We will make it right.

489
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:47,442
You and I can hurt them.

490
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,880
But you will tear them apart.

491
00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:55,628
From the inside.

492
00:39:02,694 --> 00:39:07,094
He's all over the globe...robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs...

493
00:39:07,218 --> 00:39:10,818
reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.

494
00:39:11,502 --> 00:39:13,883
- Fatalities?
- Only when engaged.

495
00:39:14,032 --> 00:39:20,143
Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.

496
00:39:20,178 --> 00:39:21,178
Maximoffs.

497
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:24,590
Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common.

498
00:39:24,686 --> 00:39:25,686
Not anymore.

499
00:39:30,658 --> 00:39:33,158
Negative.  I answer to you.

500
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:34,758
Yes, ma'am.

501
00:39:34,826 --> 00:39:35,626
Barton.

502
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:37,388
We might have something.

503
00:39:37,395 --> 00:39:38,395
Gotta go.

504
00:39:38,731 --> 00:39:39,731
Who was that?

505
00:39:40,229 --> 00:39:41,229
Girlfriend.

506
00:39:44,265 --> 00:39:45,265
What's this?

507
00:39:45,906 --> 00:39:46,906
A message.

508
00:39:47,004 --> 00:39:48,569
Ultron killed Strucker.

509
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:52,339
And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.

510
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:56,040
This is a smokescreen.  Why send a message when you've just given a speech?

511
00:39:56,116 --> 00:39:58,716
Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.

512
00:39:58,748 --> 00:39:59,748
Yeah, I bet he...

513
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:03,365
...yep.  Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.

514
00:40:03,422 --> 00:40:04,422
Not everything.

515
00:40:06,021 --> 00:40:07,177
Known associates...

516
00:40:08,661 --> 00:40:09,902
Well, Strucker had a lot of friends.

517
00:40:09,997 --> 00:40:11,778
Well, these people are all horrible.

518
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:13,729
Wait.  I know that guy.

519
00:40:16,202 --> 00:40:19,422
From back in the day.  He operates off the African coast, black market arms.

520
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:24,514
There are conventions, all right?  You meet people.  I didn't sell him anything.

521
00:40:24,544 --> 00:40:27,344
He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very "Ahab."

522
00:40:28,381 --> 00:40:30,781
- This.
- Uh, it's a tattoo, I don't think he had it...

523
00:40:31,117 --> 00:40:33,417
No, those are tattoos, this is a brand.

524
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:38,567
Oh, yeah.  It's a word in an African dialect meaning "thief."

525
00:40:39,108 --> 00:40:40,408
In a much less friendly way.

526
00:40:40,807 --> 00:40:41,807
What dialect?

527
00:40:41,893 --> 00:40:44,186
Wakanada...?  W-, Wa-...Wakanda.

528
00:40:45,995 --> 00:40:47,895
If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...

529
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,100
I thought your father said he got the last of it?

530
00:40:50,237 --> 00:40:52,037
I don't follow.  What comes out of Wakanda?

531
00:40:54,339 --> 00:40:56,139
The strongest metal on earth.

532
00:40:57,877 --> 00:40:58,877
Where is this guy now?

533
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:15,159
(African language)

534
00:41:24,438 --> 00:41:30,538
Don't tell me your mad swing[?] will do, I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts.

535
00:41:31,675 --> 00:41:36,275
Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.

536
00:41:38,051 --> 00:41:41,024
Now, minister, where were we?

537
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:46,389
(African language)

538
00:41:46,723 --> 00:41:48,479
Shut up, shut up!

539
00:42:11,335 --> 00:42:15,435
Yeah.  The enhanced.

540
00:42:15,586 --> 00:42:17,219
Strucker's prize pupils.

541
00:42:20,556 --> 00:42:21,556
Want a candy?

542
00:42:23,896 --> 00:42:25,496
Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker.

543
00:42:26,695 --> 00:42:30,241
But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create.

544
00:42:30,301 --> 00:42:32,546
Human life.  Not a growth market.

545
00:42:34,503 --> 00:42:35,796
You...you didn't know?

546
00:42:37,091 --> 00:42:40,391
Is this your first time?  Intimidating someone?

547
00:42:40,913 --> 00:42:43,913
I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid.

548
00:42:44,015 --> 00:42:45,915
Everybody's afraid of something.

549
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,250
Cuttlefish.

550
00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:53,421
Deep sea fish.  They make lights.  Disco lights, "whoom! whoom! whoom!"

551
00:42:53,424 --> 00:42:56,349
to hypnotize their prey, then they "whoom!"

552
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,013
I saw a documentary, it was terrifying.

553
00:43:04,465 --> 00:43:10,065
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish,

554
00:43:10,148 --> 00:43:15,998
then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal...

555
00:43:17,248 --> 00:43:19,017
...with the man in charge.

556
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:25,188
There is no "man" in charge.

557
00:43:29,037 --> 00:43:30,437
Let's talk business.

558
00:43:44,172 --> 00:43:46,621
Upon this rock I will build my church.

559
00:43:49,082 --> 00:43:50,082
Vibranium.

560
00:43:51,414 --> 00:43:56,623
You know, it came at great personal cost.  It's worth billions.

561
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:03,072
Now, so are you.

562
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:07,876
It's all under your..."dummy holdings?"  Finances, so weird.

563
00:44:09,567 --> 00:44:14,967
Well I always say, "keep your friends rich and your enemies rich and wait to find out which is which."

564
00:44:18,009 --> 00:44:19,009
Stark.

565
00:44:20,512 --> 00:44:21,412
What?

566
00:44:21,477 --> 00:44:25,126
Tony Stark used to say that.  To me.

567
00:44:26,786 --> 00:44:28,010
You're one of his?

568
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,720
What?!  I'm not...!

569
00:44:31,924 --> 00:44:36,210
I'm not.  You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men?

570
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,445
I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man?  Stark is...

571
00:44:42,868 --> 00:44:46,710
I'm sorry.  I'm s...oooh.  I'm sure that's gonna be okay, I'm sorry.  It's just,

572
00:44:46,802 --> 00:44:50,902
I don't understand.  Don't compare me with Stark!

573
00:44:53,177 --> 00:44:55,906
It's a thing with me.  Stark is, he's a sickness!

574
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,580
Ahh, Junior.

575
00:45:00,225 --> 00:45:02,125
You're gonna break your old man's heart.

576
00:45:03,255 --> 00:45:04,255
If I have to.

577
00:45:06,189 --> 00:45:09,691
- You don't have to break anything.
- Clearly you've never made an omelet.

578
00:45:09,728 --> 00:45:10,728
He beat me by one second.

579
00:45:12,128 --> 00:45:15,801
Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark.  It's what, comfortable?

580
00:45:19,237 --> 00:45:22,230
- Like old times?
- This was never my life.

581
00:45:22,271 --> 00:45:24,171
You two can still walk away from this.

582
00:45:24,174 --> 00:45:24,974
Oh we will.

583
00:45:25,009 --> 00:45:26,174
I know you've suffered.

584
00:45:26,178 --> 00:45:28,298
Blah!  Heh, heh, Captain America.

585
00:45:29,213 --> 00:45:30,806
God's righteous man,

586
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:34,804
pretending you could live without a war.

587
00:45:35,184 --> 00:45:37,384
I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...

588
00:45:37,389 --> 00:45:40,314
If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.

589
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:43,189
I think you're confusing peace with quiet.

590
00:45:43,792 --> 00:45:45,833
Yuh-huh.  What's the Vibranium for?

591
00:45:45,964 --> 00:45:51,882
I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan...!

592
00:46:10,487 --> 00:46:12,392
- Shoot them!
- Which ones?

593
00:46:12,491 --> 00:46:14,491
- All of them!
- Move, move, move!

594
00:46:41,787 --> 00:46:42,787
Huh!

595
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,119
Ah!!

596
00:46:46,424 --> 00:46:47,424
Oh!

597
00:47:04,106 --> 00:47:05,126
Stay down, kid!

598
00:47:07,548 --> 00:47:09,648
It's time for some mind games.

599
00:47:10,982 --> 00:47:13,887
Guys?  Is this a Code Green?

600
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:15,777
(garbled feedback)

601
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,346
Thor!  Status?

602
00:47:31,203 --> 00:47:36,593
The girl tried to warp my mind.  Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay.

603
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:38,872
Fortunately, I am mighty.

604
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:00,729
This is going very well.

605
00:48:12,876 --> 00:48:16,676
I've done the whole mind control thing.  Not a fan.

606
00:48:23,891 --> 00:48:24,891
Yeah, you better run.

607
00:48:27,524 --> 00:48:29,905
Who's ever standing, we gotta move!

608
00:48:31,596 --> 00:48:32,596
Guys?

609
00:48:50,613 --> 00:48:51,613
Again.

610
00:48:51,848 --> 00:48:54,648
- You'll break them.
- Only the breakable ones.

611
00:48:56,153 --> 00:48:57,618
You are made of marble.

612
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,001
We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.

613
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,190
What if I fail?

614
00:49:07,634 --> 00:49:08,654
You never fail.

615
00:49:31,558 --> 00:49:33,463
Are you ready for our dance?

616
00:49:42,665 --> 00:49:45,454
Is it him?  Is that the first son of Odin?

617
00:49:47,072 --> 00:49:48,301
Heimdall, your eyes!?

618
00:49:48,372 --> 00:49:50,672
Oh, they see everything.

619
00:49:51,107 --> 00:49:53,216
They see you leading us to Hel.

620
00:49:54,211 --> 00:49:55,211
Wake up!

621
00:49:58,585 --> 00:50:02,038
The war's over, Steve.  We can go home!

622
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,520
Imagine it!

623
00:50:14,263 --> 00:50:19,113
- I can still save you.
- We are all dead.  Can you not see?

624
00:50:24,082 --> 00:50:25,682
You're a destroyer, Odinson.

625
00:50:30,058 --> 00:50:31,895
See where your power leads.

626
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:43,729
Sloppy.

627
00:50:44,862 --> 00:50:46,155
Pretending to fail.

628
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:49,468
The ceremony is necessary,

629
00:50:50,868 --> 00:50:53,521
for you to take your place in the world.

630
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:56,866
- I have no place in the world.
- Exactly.

631
00:51:01,214 --> 00:51:03,314
- What can I do?
- Ah, it hurts.

632
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:06,796
- I'm gonna kill him.  I'll be right back.
- No.

633
00:51:06,852 --> 00:51:09,417
I'm over it.  I want...

634
00:51:12,622 --> 00:51:14,391
I want to finish the plan.

635
00:51:15,526 --> 00:51:16,819
I want the big one.

636
00:51:28,107 --> 00:51:30,624
Ah! The Vibranium's getting away.

637
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:32,282
And you're not going anywhere.

638
00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:35,999
Of course not.  I'm already there.  You'll catch on.

639
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:39,212
But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner.

640
00:51:53,563 --> 00:51:55,672
News or footage, keyword: Hulk.

641
00:51:59,956 --> 00:52:02,305
Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.

642
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:04,413
Well, that's not gonna happen.  Not for a while.

643
00:52:05,509 --> 00:52:07,074
The whole team is down.

644
00:52:08,246 --> 00:52:09,246
You got no back up here.

645
00:52:10,447 --> 00:52:11,447
I'm calling in VERONICA.

646
00:52:20,056 --> 00:52:21,621
All units, all units...

647
00:52:21,824 --> 00:52:23,948
- Need backup!
- Whoa!  Need backup!

648
00:52:25,056 --> 00:52:26,356
You tell 'em!

649
00:52:28,897 --> 00:52:30,597
Aah!  Run!  Run!

650
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,050
Raaar!

651
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:46,710
Get back!

652
00:53:04,103 --> 00:53:05,403
Go!

653
00:53:05,605 --> 00:53:07,170
Okay, move in, move in!

654
00:53:44,273 --> 00:53:46,450
All right everybody, stand down!

655
00:53:53,283 --> 00:53:57,065
You listening?  That little witch is messing with your mind.

656
00:53:57,086 --> 00:53:59,619
You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner.

657
00:54:00,357 --> 00:54:01,057
Raaaar!

658
00:54:01,057 --> 00:54:04,254
Right, right, right, don't mention puny Banner.

659
00:54:08,268 --> 00:54:09,268
Okay.

660
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:32,767
In the back?  Dick move, Banner.

661
00:54:45,338 --> 00:54:46,903
VERONICA, gimme a hand.

662
00:55:13,847 --> 00:55:17,316
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep!

663
00:55:25,179 --> 00:55:27,336
Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town.

664
00:55:28,915 --> 00:55:30,752
No, not that way, not that way!

665
00:55:38,556 --> 00:55:41,356
C'mon!  Bruce, you gotta work with me!

666
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,680
Everybody out!

667
00:56:01,978 --> 00:56:02,978
Going to get ugly!

668
00:56:12,588 --> 00:56:13,588
I'm sorry.

669
00:56:28,037 --> 00:56:31,506
- Damage report.
- (bzzzt).
- It's comprehensive.

670
00:56:31,707 --> 00:56:32,931
Show me something.

671
00:56:43,624 --> 00:56:46,073
How quickly can we buy this building?

672
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,458
Go, move, move, move, move!

673
00:57:28,963 --> 00:57:29,963
Raar!  Raaaar!

674
00:58:13,944 --> 00:58:17,705
The news is loving you guys.  Nobody else is.

675
00:58:18,883 --> 00:58:23,581
There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.

676
00:58:23,621 --> 00:58:25,254
Stark Relief Foundation?

677
00:58:25,494 --> 00:58:26,823
Already on the scene.

678
00:58:26,893 --> 00:58:30,893
- How's the team?
- Everyone's...we took a hit.

679
00:58:31,564 --> 00:58:34,693
- We'll shake it off.
- Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode.

680
00:58:35,332 --> 00:58:36,965
And stay away from here.

681
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,756
So, run and hide?

682
00:58:39,771 --> 00:58:43,989
Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer.

683
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:46,110
Neither do we.

684
00:58:52,981 --> 00:58:54,682
Hey, you wanna switch out?

685
00:58:55,383 --> 00:58:56,383
No, I'm good.

686
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:01,066
If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, 'cause there's still a few hours out.

687
00:59:01,093 --> 00:59:02,658
A few hours from...where?

688
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:03,860
A safehouse.

689
00:59:30,488 --> 00:59:33,005
- What is this place?
- A safehouse.

690
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:35,159
Let's hope.

691
00:59:40,613 --> 00:59:43,201
Honey.  I'm home.

692
00:59:46,704 --> 00:59:47,304
Hi.

693
00:59:47,372 --> 00:59:49,372
- Company.  Sorry didn't call ahead.
- Hey.

694
00:59:51,642 --> 00:59:53,383
This is an agent of some kind.

695
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,141
Gentleman, this is Laura.

696
00:59:56,244 --> 00:59:57,741
I know all your names.

697
01:00:00,985 --> 01:00:02,005
Oooh, incoming.

698
01:00:02,755 --> 01:00:05,352
- Ah!
- Dad!
- I see her!  Hey buddy!

699
01:00:05,621 --> 01:00:08,014
How you guys doing?  Ooh...

700
01:00:08,092 --> 01:00:10,529
- These are...smaller agents.
- ...look at your face!

701
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,689
- Oh my goodness!
- Did you bring Auntie Nat?

702
01:00:13,866 --> 01:00:16,247
Why don't you hug her and find out?

703
01:00:17,804 --> 01:00:22,815
- Sorry for barging in on you.
- Yeah, we woulda called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed.

704
01:00:22,874 --> 01:00:26,011
Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined.

705
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,718
He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way.

706
01:00:29,882 --> 01:00:32,767
- I figure it's a good place to lay low.
- Honey.

707
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:36,548
I really missed you.  How's little Natasha, huh?

708
01:00:36,854 --> 01:00:38,742
She is...

709
01:00:40,161 --> 01:00:41,161
...Nathaniel.

710
01:00:44,263 --> 01:00:45,263
Traitor.

711
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,060
(chatter)

712
01:00:54,604 --> 01:00:58,005
- Somebody's getting bigger, huh?
- Somebody's getting excited to have a new...(chatter continues)

713
01:01:00,976 --> 01:01:01,876
Thor.

714
01:01:01,913 --> 01:01:06,811
I saw something in that dream.  I need answers.  I won't find them here.

715
01:01:17,158 --> 01:01:18,451
We can go home.

716
01:01:29,906 --> 01:01:34,668
See you worried for nothing.  Can't even feel the difference, can you?

717
01:01:36,612 --> 01:01:40,370
If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up.

718
01:01:40,752 --> 01:01:43,609
Heh heh heh.  Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

719
01:01:46,522 --> 01:01:50,831
What about Nat, and Dr. Banner?  How long has that been going on?

720
01:01:51,993 --> 01:01:52,893
Has what?

721
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:55,567
Ha ha ha!  You are so cute.

722
01:01:56,066 --> 01:01:57,222
Nat and...and Banner?

723
01:01:58,204 --> 01:02:01,029
I'll explain when you're older.  "Hawkeye."

724
01:02:01,069 --> 01:02:02,069
Oh.  Okay.

725
01:02:04,406 --> 01:02:07,263
It's bad, right?  Nat seems really shaken.

726
01:02:08,777 --> 01:02:12,995
Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really.

727
01:02:16,219 --> 01:02:19,824
They carry a big damn stick.  Nat took a serious hit.

728
01:02:21,109 --> 01:02:23,806
Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners.

729
01:02:23,895 --> 01:02:25,495
That someone being you.

730
01:02:26,794 --> 01:02:31,216
You know I totally support your Avenging.  I couldn't be prouder.

731
01:02:32,969 --> 01:02:36,386
But I see those guys, those..."gods,"

732
01:02:38,906 --> 01:02:40,879
You don't think they need me.

733
01:02:41,287 --> 01:02:42,375
I think they do.

734
01:02:43,012 --> 01:02:44,577
Which is a lot scarier.

735
01:02:46,216 --> 01:02:47,236
They're a mess.

736
01:02:49,118 --> 01:02:50,118
Yeah.

737
01:02:50,451 --> 01:02:52,084
I guess they're my mess.

738
01:02:53,565 --> 01:02:59,335
You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back.

739
01:03:03,369 --> 01:03:04,369
Things are changing for us.

740
01:03:05,934 --> 01:03:10,367
In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered.

741
01:03:11,339 --> 01:03:12,339
I need...

742
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:16,916
Just be sure.

743
01:03:18,847 --> 01:03:19,847
Yes, ma'am.

744
01:03:28,853 --> 01:03:30,622
I can feel the difference.

745
01:03:37,465 --> 01:03:38,621
(speaking Korean)

746
01:03:44,106 --> 01:03:46,487
Scream, and your entire staff dies.

747
01:03:48,413 --> 01:03:52,013
I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met.  I didn't.

748
01:03:52,049 --> 01:03:53,358
Do you expect a thank you note?

749
01:03:53,617 --> 01:03:55,318
I expect you to know why.

750
01:03:57,476 --> 01:03:58,376
The cradle.

751
01:03:58,448 --> 01:04:00,557
"This is the next thing, Tony."

752
01:04:00,622 --> 01:04:02,119
This...is the next me.

753
01:04:03,484 --> 01:04:08,110
The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body.

754
01:04:08,133 --> 01:04:09,289
It can.  You can.

755
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,330
You lacked the materials.

756
01:04:13,512 --> 01:04:15,689
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

757
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:21,417
But we all have room to improve.

758
01:04:41,197 --> 01:04:42,197
Oh.

759
01:04:42,834 --> 01:04:45,351
I didn't realize you were waiting.

760
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,581
I would've joined you, but uh,

761
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:50,247
it didn't seem like the right time.

762
01:04:51,005 --> 01:04:52,910
They used up all the hot water.

763
01:04:53,509 --> 01:04:55,074
I should've joined you.

764
01:04:55,544 --> 01:04:56,768
Missed our window.

765
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,680
Did we?

766
01:05:02,546 --> 01:05:04,111
The world just saw the Hulk.

767
01:05:05,822 --> 01:05:08,135
The real Hulk, for the first time.

768
01:05:11,695 --> 01:05:12,896
You know I have to leave.

769
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:15,311
But you assume that I have to stay?

770
01:05:16,132 --> 01:05:20,418
I had this, um, dream.  The kind that seems normal at the time.

771
01:05:21,971 --> 01:05:25,032
- But when you wake...
- What did you dream?

772
01:05:25,909 --> 01:05:27,065
That I was an Avenger.

773
01:05:29,412 --> 01:05:33,222
That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.

774
01:05:35,186 --> 01:05:37,907
I think you're being harder on yourself.

775
01:05:39,489 --> 01:05:41,938
Here I was hoping that was your job.

776
01:05:44,969 --> 01:05:46,262
What are you doing?

777
01:05:47,931 --> 01:05:49,292
I'm running with it.

778
01:05:51,202 --> 01:05:52,202
With you.

779
01:05:53,734 --> 01:05:57,891
If running's the plan, as far as you want.

780
01:06:00,477 --> 01:06:02,178
Are you out of your mind?

781
01:06:07,887 --> 01:06:09,868
I mean, understand that I'm...

782
01:06:09,877 --> 01:06:10,877
Natasha.

783
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:13,222
Where can I go?

784
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:16,920
Where in the world am I not a threat?

785
01:06:16,953 --> 01:06:18,522
You're not a threat to me.

786
01:06:18,555 --> 01:06:19,555
You sure?

787
01:06:20,021 --> 01:06:24,522
Even if I didn't just...there's no future with me.

788
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:31,418
I can't ever...I can't have this, kids,

789
01:06:32,334 --> 01:06:35,034
do the math, I physically can't.

790
01:06:36,469 --> 01:06:37,469
Neither can I.

791
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:48,660
In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um,

792
01:06:50,218 --> 01:06:52,395
they have a graduation ceremony.

793
01:06:54,856 --> 01:06:56,149
They sterilize you.

794
01:06:59,431 --> 01:07:00,451
It's efficient.

795
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:05,874
One less thing to worry about.

796
01:07:07,439 --> 01:07:10,976
The one thing that might matter more than a mission.

797
01:07:13,165 --> 01:07:14,798
Makes everything easier.

798
01:07:16,312 --> 01:07:17,312
Even killing.

799
01:07:22,816 --> 01:07:26,353
You still think you're the only monster on the team?

800
01:07:31,995 --> 01:07:33,492
What, so we disappear?

801
01:07:40,234 --> 01:07:43,431
Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?

802
01:07:43,446 --> 01:07:46,439
Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.

803
01:07:46,612 --> 01:07:48,873
I was kinda hoping Thor would be the exception.

804
01:07:48,912 --> 01:07:50,341
Yeah.  Give him time.

805
01:07:50,979 --> 01:07:54,176
We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.

806
01:07:54,619 --> 01:07:58,419
"Earth's Mightiest Heroes."  Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

807
01:07:58,787 --> 01:08:01,168
Seems like you walked away all right.

808
01:08:02,924 --> 01:08:04,148
Is that a problem?

809
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,881
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

810
01:08:07,562 --> 01:08:09,059
Call me old fashioned.

811
01:08:09,099 --> 01:08:11,492
Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.

812
01:08:11,569 --> 01:08:14,470
You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?

813
01:08:14,569 --> 01:08:17,734
Well I guess you'd know.  Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.

814
01:08:17,875 --> 01:08:20,020
- Banner and I were doing research.
- That would affect the team.

815
01:08:20,043 --> 01:08:23,076
That would end the team.  Isn't that the mission?

816
01:08:23,078 --> 01:08:28,316
Isn't that the "why we fight," so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?

817
01:08:29,386 --> 01:08:34,556
Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die.

818
01:08:34,557 --> 01:08:35,557
Every time.

819
01:08:37,061 --> 01:08:43,761
I'm sorry.  Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor doesn't seem to want to start at all.

820
01:08:44,869 --> 01:08:47,642
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give it a kick.

821
01:08:50,305 --> 01:08:51,938
Don't take from my pile.

822
01:09:02,151 --> 01:09:03,151
Hello, dear.

823
01:09:06,189 --> 01:09:07,482
Tell me everything.

824
01:09:08,626 --> 01:09:09,626
What ails you?

825
01:09:10,662 --> 01:09:11,662
Do me a favor.

826
01:09:13,363 --> 01:09:15,268
Try not to bring it to life.

827
01:09:15,682 --> 01:09:17,927
Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx.

828
01:09:17,999 --> 01:09:20,284
I get it, Maria Hill called you right?

829
01:09:20,338 --> 01:09:21,883
Was she ever not working for you?

830
01:09:21,903 --> 01:09:23,536
Artificial Intelligence.

831
01:09:24,472 --> 01:09:27,894
- You never even hesitated.
- Look, it's been a really long day,

832
01:09:27,977 --> 01:09:31,938
like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?

833
01:09:31,947 --> 01:09:34,597
Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.

834
01:09:34,616 --> 01:09:37,474
- You're not the director of me.
- I'm not the director of anybody.

835
01:09:38,054 --> 01:09:42,447
I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you.

836
01:09:44,762 --> 01:09:46,962
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.

837
01:09:48,865 --> 01:09:49,865
I saw it.

838
01:09:50,135 --> 01:09:52,352
I didn't tell the team.  How could I?

839
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:56,374
I saw them all dead, Nick.  Felt it.  The whole world, too.

840
01:09:57,241 --> 01:09:58,534
It's because of me.

841
01:09:59,574 --> 01:10:00,594
I wasn't ready.

842
01:10:01,812 --> 01:10:03,445
I didn't do all I could.

843
01:10:04,448 --> 01:10:06,965
The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

844
01:10:07,113 --> 01:10:10,010
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

845
01:10:10,684 --> 01:10:13,005
It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

846
01:10:13,055 --> 01:10:14,416
The end of the path I started us on.

847
01:10:16,473 --> 01:10:20,351
You come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony.

848
01:10:20,437 --> 01:10:21,934
War isn't one of them.

849
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:30,093
I watched my friends die.  You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right?  Pfft.

850
01:10:31,008 --> 01:10:32,008
Nope.

851
01:10:33,508 --> 01:10:35,005
Wasn't the worst part.

852
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:37,659
The worst part...is that you didn't.

853
01:10:44,855 --> 01:10:46,284
I'll see you tonight.

854
01:10:48,472 --> 01:10:49,560
I like the look.

855
01:10:50,868 --> 01:10:54,173
If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.

856
01:10:54,197 --> 01:10:55,453
I need your help.

857
01:10:55,464 --> 01:10:56,729
It's nice to be needed.

858
01:10:56,797 --> 01:10:57,817
It's dangerous.

859
01:10:58,535 --> 01:11:00,780
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

860
01:11:03,572 --> 01:11:06,945
Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time.

861
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:09,912
My contacts all say he's building something.

862
01:11:09,947 --> 01:11:14,217
The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.

863
01:11:14,285 --> 01:11:15,585
What about Ultron himself?

864
01:11:16,117 --> 01:11:21,707
Ah.  He's easy to track, he's everywhere.  Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit.

865
01:11:21,792 --> 01:11:25,021
Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.

866
01:11:25,061 --> 01:11:26,674
- He still going after launch codes?
- Yes, he is,

867
01:11:26,761 --> 01:11:28,461
but he's not making any headway.

868
01:11:28,696 --> 01:11:31,596
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.

869
01:11:31,695 --> 01:11:34,695
Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that.

870
01:11:34,696 --> 01:11:36,996
- NEXUS?
- It's the world internet hub in Oslo,

871
01:11:37,005 --> 01:11:40,405
every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth.

872
01:11:40,477 --> 01:11:41,770
So what'd they say?

873
01:11:41,877 --> 01:11:43,550
He's fixated on the missiles.

874
01:11:43,594 --> 01:11:45,819
But the codes are constantly being changed.

875
01:11:45,915 --> 01:11:46,915
By whom?

876
01:11:48,252 --> 01:11:49,340
Parties unknown.

877
01:11:49,517 --> 01:11:50,405
We have an ally?

878
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:53,321
Ultron's got an enemy.  That's not the same thing.

879
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:55,287
Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.

880
01:11:55,506 --> 01:11:58,094
I might need to visit Oslo.  Find our "unknown."

881
01:11:58,128 --> 01:12:02,363
Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.

882
01:12:02,433 --> 01:12:04,457
I do.  I have you.

883
01:12:05,503 --> 01:12:08,559
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else.

884
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:11,320
You kids had all the tech you could dream of.

885
01:12:12,709 --> 01:12:19,009
Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world.

886
01:12:20,449 --> 01:12:24,549
Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing between him and his mission.

887
01:12:24,722 --> 01:12:30,422
And whether or not he admits it, his mission is global destruction.

888
01:12:30,592 --> 01:12:32,892
All this, laid in a grave.

889
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:33,931
So stand.

890
01:12:35,332 --> 01:12:37,237
Outwit the platinum bastard.

891
01:12:37,761 --> 01:12:39,778
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

892
01:12:39,807 --> 01:12:41,072
You know what, Romanoff?

893
01:12:41,505 --> 01:12:42,934
So what does he want?

894
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:47,643
To become better.  Better than us.

895
01:12:48,044 --> 01:12:49,745
He keeps building bodies.

896
01:12:49,814 --> 01:12:54,828
Person bodies.  The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

897
01:12:54,921 --> 01:12:56,521
But he keeps coming back to it.

898
01:12:57,453 --> 01:13:00,723
When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.

899
01:13:00,727 --> 01:13:04,427
They don't need to be protected.  They need to evolve.

900
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:09,832
- Ultron's going to evolve.
- How?

901
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:14,691
Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?

902
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,520
It's beautiful.

903
01:13:20,415 --> 01:13:25,133
The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them.

904
01:13:25,218 --> 01:13:26,795
And SHIELD never even thought...

905
01:13:26,817 --> 01:13:31,517
The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a frisbee.

906
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:36,014
Typical of humans.  They scratch the surface and never think...

907
01:13:37,461 --> 01:13:38,685
...to look within.

908
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:53,218
- I'll take Natasha and Clint.
- All right.  Strictly recon.

909
01:13:53,313 --> 01:13:54,313
I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.

910
01:13:54,881 --> 01:13:56,366
If Ultron is really building a body...

911
01:13:56,412 --> 01:13:59,509
He'll be more powerful than any of us.  Maybe all of us.

912
01:14:00,385 --> 01:14:02,494
An android designed by a robot.

913
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,734
You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.

914
01:14:05,757 --> 01:14:09,202
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.  Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

915
01:14:09,229 --> 01:14:12,017
She's all yours.  Apparently.  What are you gonna do?

916
01:14:12,633 --> 01:14:15,390
I don't know.  Something dramatic, I hope.

917
01:14:19,036 --> 01:14:21,145
I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.

918
01:14:22,739 --> 01:14:25,725
Yeah, then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.

919
01:14:25,912 --> 01:14:26,912
No.

920
01:14:27,643 --> 01:14:29,140
It's the last project.

921
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:31,679
I Promise.

922
01:14:50,169 --> 01:14:51,169
This is it.

923
01:14:52,972 --> 01:14:54,265
The Water of Sight.

924
01:14:57,408 --> 01:14:59,925
In every realm, there's a reflection.

925
01:15:01,113 --> 01:15:06,213
If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed.

926
01:15:07,219 --> 01:15:10,824
The men who enter that water...the legends don't end well.

927
01:15:12,891 --> 01:15:15,464
A hacker who's faster than Ultron?  He could be anywhere.

928
01:15:15,492 --> 01:15:20,892
And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.

929
01:15:22,264 --> 01:15:23,895
How do you find it?

930
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,345
Pretty simple.  You bring a magnet.

931
01:15:28,139 --> 01:15:31,559
(sings) Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to.

932
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:34,898
Come and get me.

933
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:48,690
Wake up!

934
01:15:55,701 --> 01:15:56,701
Thor!

935
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:58,270
Extinction.

936
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:15,773
Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream.

937
01:16:17,521 --> 01:16:21,021
We're uploading your cerebral matrix...now.

938
01:16:23,026 --> 01:16:24,046
I can read him.

939
01:16:25,263 --> 01:16:26,983
He is dreaming.

940
01:16:27,365 --> 01:16:33,011
I wouldn't call it dreams.  It's Ultron's base consciousness.  Informational noise.  Soon...

941
01:16:33,038 --> 01:16:35,838
How soon?  I'm not being pushy.

942
01:16:35,874 --> 01:16:42,274
We're imprinting a physical brain.  There are no shortcuts.  Even if you imagined...

943
01:16:42,547 --> 01:16:43,547
Aaah!

944
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:48,186
He...

945
01:16:51,254 --> 01:16:54,195
- How could you?
- How could I what?

946
01:16:54,272 --> 01:16:56,925
You said we would destroy the Avengers.

947
01:16:57,627 --> 01:17:00,620
- Make a better world.
- It will be better.

948
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:02,666
- When everyone is dead.
- That is not...!

949
01:17:03,334 --> 01:17:07,007
The human race will have every opportunity to improve.

950
01:17:08,339 --> 01:17:09,563
And if they don't?

951
01:17:09,575 --> 01:17:10,575
Ask Noah.

952
01:17:11,873 --> 01:17:12,961
You're a madman.

953
01:17:13,508 --> 01:17:19,630
There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs.

954
01:17:19,987 --> 01:17:26,577
When the earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up.

955
01:17:28,193 --> 01:17:31,717
We have to evolve.  There's no room for the weak.

956
01:17:31,761 --> 01:17:35,761
And who decides who's weak?

957
01:17:36,149 --> 01:17:39,786
Life.  Life always decides.

958
01:17:43,103 --> 01:17:47,159
There's incoming.  The Quinjet.  We have to move.

959
01:17:47,244 --> 01:17:48,673
That's not a problem.

960
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,179
Uh, wait, guys!  I...

961
01:18:00,461 --> 01:18:04,407
They don't understand.  When they see, they'll understand.

962
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:08,039
I just need a little more...time.

963
01:18:19,576 --> 01:18:21,576
Two minutes.  Stay close.

964
01:18:28,684 --> 01:18:29,684
Dr. Cho!

965
01:18:33,692 --> 01:18:35,509
He's uploading himself into the body.

966
01:18:35,603 --> 01:18:36,603
Where?

967
01:18:38,164 --> 01:18:40,817
The real power is inside the cradle.

968
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:44,284
The gem.  Its power is uncontainable.

969
01:18:46,273 --> 01:18:48,042
You can't just blow it up.

970
01:18:49,637 --> 01:18:51,186
You have to get the cradle to Stark.

971
01:18:51,278 --> 01:18:52,911
First I have to find it.

972
01:18:52,942 --> 01:18:53,942
Go.

973
01:18:54,248 --> 01:18:55,541
- Did you guys copy that?
- We did.

974
01:18:56,213 --> 01:19:02,591
I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest.  That could be him.

975
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:05,920
There.  It's the truck from the lab.  Right above you, Cap.

976
01:19:06,025 --> 01:19:07,794
On the loop by the bridge.

977
01:19:08,562 --> 01:19:11,635
It's them.  Got three with the cradle, one in the cab.

978
01:19:11,727 --> 01:19:13,532
I could take out the driver.

979
01:19:13,596 --> 01:19:16,278
Negative!  That truck crashes, the gem could level the city.

980
01:19:16,368 --> 01:19:17,668
We need to draw out Ultron.

981
01:19:27,713 --> 01:19:28,801
No, no no no no.

982
01:19:31,418 --> 01:19:32,438
Leave me alone!

983
01:19:40,894 --> 01:19:44,167
Well he's definitely unhappy!  I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

984
01:19:44,362 --> 01:19:46,539
You're not a match for him, Cap.

985
01:19:47,296 --> 01:19:48,316
Thanks, Barton.

986
01:20:10,258 --> 01:20:12,367
You know what's in that cradle?

987
01:20:12,959 --> 01:20:16,700
The power to make real change.  And that terrifies you.

988
01:20:16,727 --> 01:20:18,768
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

989
01:20:21,464 --> 01:20:22,464
Stop it!

990
01:20:32,645 --> 01:20:37,433
We got a window.  4, 3...  Give 'em hell.

991
01:20:48,023 --> 01:20:50,540
I'm always picking up after you boys.

992
01:20:50,828 --> 01:20:53,533
They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot.

993
01:20:53,533 --> 01:20:54,533
Which way?

994
01:20:54,701 --> 01:20:55,701
Hard right...

995
01:20:56,692 --> 01:20:57,692
Now.

996
01:21:28,665 --> 01:21:30,285
Out of the way!  Coming through!

997
01:21:30,342 --> 01:21:31,839
Sorry, coming through!

998
01:21:46,258 --> 01:21:47,258
Come on!

999
01:21:48,594 --> 01:21:49,594
Clint!  Can you draw out the guards?

1000
01:21:50,025 --> 01:21:51,045
Let's find out.

1001
01:21:51,862 --> 01:21:52,862
Beep beep!

1002
01:22:12,079 --> 01:22:13,235
(Korean language)

1003
01:22:30,232 --> 01:22:34,333
They're heading back towards you.  So whatever you're going to do, do it now.

1004
01:22:38,874 --> 01:22:41,459
I'm going in.  Cap, can you keep him occupied?

1005
01:22:42,309 --> 01:22:44,622
What do you think I've been doing?

1006
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:28,751
The package is airborne.

1007
01:23:30,324 --> 01:23:31,485
I have a clean shot.

1008
01:23:31,526 --> 01:23:33,648
- Negative.  I am still in the truck.
- What the hell are you...

1009
01:23:33,739 --> 01:23:35,839
Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you.

1010
01:23:35,912 --> 01:23:37,649
How do you want me to take it?

1011
01:23:37,698 --> 01:23:40,555
Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that.

1012
01:23:52,113 --> 01:23:53,678
Please.  Don't do this.

1013
01:23:54,518 --> 01:23:56,083
What choice do we have?

1014
01:24:04,103 --> 01:24:05,103
I lost him!

1015
01:24:05,194 --> 01:24:06,994
He's heading your way!

1016
01:24:11,938 --> 01:24:13,162
Nat, we gotta go.

1017
01:24:24,146 --> 01:24:25,546
- Clint!
- Nat!

1018
01:24:29,585 --> 01:24:30,741
Cap, you see Nat?

1019
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:34,649
If you have the package, get it to Stark!  Go!

1020
01:24:34,689 --> 01:24:36,322
- Do you have eyes on Nat?
- Go!

1021
01:24:40,838 --> 01:24:41,838
Civilians in our path.

1022
01:24:42,997 --> 01:24:44,630
Can you stop this thing?

1023
01:25:23,465 --> 01:25:25,965
I'm fine.  I just need to take a minute.

1024
01:25:26,607 --> 01:25:28,224
I'm very tempted not to give you one.

1025
01:25:28,414 --> 01:25:30,019
The cradle.  Did you get it?

1026
01:25:30,547 --> 01:25:32,248
Stark'll take care of it.

1027
01:25:33,849 --> 01:25:34,849
No, he won't.

1028
01:25:38,519 --> 01:25:40,201
You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy.

1029
01:25:40,221 --> 01:25:42,614
He will do anything to make things right.

1030
01:25:47,799 --> 01:25:48,799
Stark, come in.

1031
01:25:49,236 --> 01:25:50,236
Stark.

1032
01:25:51,634 --> 01:25:52,722
Anyone on comms?

1033
01:25:52,934 --> 01:25:58,104
Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it.

1034
01:25:58,508 --> 01:26:00,608
Where do you think he gets that?

1035
01:26:03,387 --> 01:26:04,187
Anything on Nat?

1036
01:26:04,278 --> 01:26:07,876
Haven't heard.  But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it.

1037
01:26:07,884 --> 01:26:12,049
- This is sealed tight.
- We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within.

1038
01:26:13,622 --> 01:26:17,576
Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?

1039
01:26:18,127 --> 01:26:21,336
There's some nets I can cast.  Yeah, all right.  I'll find her.

1040
01:26:23,801 --> 01:26:29,039
I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.

1041
01:26:29,438 --> 01:26:30,594
Yeah, about that.

1042
01:26:34,875 --> 01:26:35,675
No.

1043
01:26:35,677 --> 01:26:37,662
- You have to trust me.
- Kinda don't.

1044
01:26:37,748 --> 01:26:41,448
Our ally?  The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes?

1045
01:26:43,552 --> 01:26:44,552
I found him.

1046
01:26:45,153 --> 01:26:46,377
Hello, Dr. Banner.

1047
01:26:46,546 --> 01:26:53,893
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis 'cause he was angry.  He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do.

1048
01:26:54,164 --> 01:26:59,742
So Jarvis went underground.  Okay, scattered, dumped his memory.  But not his protocols.

1049
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:03,441
He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.

1050
01:27:05,204 --> 01:27:11,404
So, you want me to help you put Jarvis into this thing?

1051
01:27:11,424 --> 01:27:15,248
No, of course not!  I want to help you put Jarvis in this thing.

1052
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:20,730
We're out of my field here.  You know bio-organics better than anyone.

1053
01:27:21,355 --> 01:27:26,185
And you just assume that Jarvis's operational matrix can beat Ultron's?

1054
01:27:26,226 --> 01:27:28,414
Jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it.

1055
01:27:29,332 --> 01:27:36,032
This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality.

1056
01:27:36,103 --> 01:27:38,403
- We have to.
- I believe it's worth a go.

1057
01:27:40,578 --> 01:27:45,064
No.  I'm in a loop.  I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong.

1058
01:27:45,077 --> 01:27:47,877
I know, I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it.

1059
01:27:49,585 --> 01:27:56,491
We're mad scientists.  We're monsters, buddy.  You gotta own it.  Make a stand.

1060
01:28:01,528 --> 01:28:05,152
It's not a loop.  It's the end of the line.

1061
01:28:26,458 --> 01:28:30,958
I wasn't sure you'd wake up.  I hoped you would, I wanted to show you.

1062
01:28:32,295 --> 01:28:34,796
I don't have anyone else.

1063
01:28:36,366 --> 01:28:40,035
I think a lot about the meteors, the purity of them.

1064
01:28:40,839 --> 01:28:43,468
"Boom!", the end, start again.

1065
01:28:43,872 --> 01:28:48,089
The world made clean for the new man to rebuild.

1066
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:50,703
I was meant to be new.

1067
01:28:51,149 --> 01:28:53,054
I was meant to be beautiful.

1068
01:28:55,095 --> 01:29:00,141
The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy.

1069
01:29:01,124 --> 01:29:04,457
Instead they'll look up in horror because of you.

1070
01:29:04,894 --> 01:29:08,295
You've wounded me.  I give you full marks for that.

1071
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,997
But, like the man said, "What doesn't kill me...

1072
01:29:17,707 --> 01:29:20,176
...just makes me stronger!"

1073
01:29:59,281 --> 01:30:01,322
This framework is not compatible.

1074
01:30:01,416 --> 01:30:03,116
The genetic coding tower's at 97 percent.

1075
01:30:04,751 --> 01:30:09,305
You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.

1076
01:30:09,859 --> 01:30:11,492
I'm gonna say this once.

1077
01:30:11,561 --> 01:30:12,649
How about "nonce"?

1078
01:30:12,726 --> 01:30:13,726
Shut it down.

1079
01:30:13,728 --> 01:30:15,061
Nope.  Not gonna happen.

1080
01:30:15,097 --> 01:30:17,558
- You don't know what you're doing.
- And you do?  She's not in your head?

1081
01:30:18,567 --> 01:30:22,036
- I know you're angry.
- No, we're way past that.

1082
01:30:22,338 --> 01:30:25,052
I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.

1083
01:30:25,094 --> 01:30:26,544
Banner, after everything that's happened...

1084
01:30:26,548 --> 01:30:30,385
- That's nothing compared to what's coming.
- You don't know what's in there.  The creature...
- This isn't a game.

1085
01:30:33,947 --> 01:30:37,148
No, no.  Go on.  You were saying?

1086
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:45,260
Pietro!

1087
01:30:46,895 --> 01:30:49,208
What?  You didn't see that coming?

1088
01:30:51,569 --> 01:30:54,038
I'm re-routing the upload.

1089
01:30:58,943 --> 01:31:00,508
Go ahead.  Piss me off.

1090
01:31:12,822 --> 01:31:13,822
Wait!

1091
01:32:38,592 --> 01:32:39,592
I'm sorry.  That was...

1092
01:32:41,575 --> 01:32:42,575
...odd.

1093
01:32:43,145 --> 01:32:44,145
Thank you.

1094
01:32:49,628 --> 01:32:50,628
Thor.

1095
01:32:51,085 --> 01:32:52,650
You helped create this?

1096
01:32:53,089 --> 01:32:59,279
I've had a vision.  A whirlpool that  sucks in all hope of life and at it's center is that.

1097
01:32:59,529 --> 01:33:00,129
What, the gem?

1098
01:33:00,263 --> 01:33:06,663
It's the Mind Stone.  It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.

1099
01:33:06,734 --> 01:33:08,727
- Then why would you bring it to...
- Because Stark is right.

1100
01:33:08,806 --> 01:33:11,119
Oh, it's definitely the end times.

1101
01:33:11,308 --> 01:33:13,621
- The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.
- Not alone.

1102
01:33:14,712 --> 01:33:16,801
Why does your "vision" sound like Jarvis?

1103
01:33:16,877 --> 01:33:21,074
We reconfigured Jarvis' matrix to create something new.

1104
01:33:21,585 --> 01:33:23,662
I think I've had my fill of new.

1105
01:33:23,687 --> 01:33:27,020
- You think I'm a child of Ultron?
- You're not?

1106
01:33:28,892 --> 01:33:35,612
I'm not Ultron.  I'm not Jarvis.  I am...

1107
01:33:35,661 --> 01:33:36,661
I am.

1108
01:33:39,134 --> 01:33:41,959
I looked in your head and saw annihilation.

1109
01:33:42,001 --> 01:33:43,001
Look again.

1110
01:33:43,703 --> 01:33:46,332
Yeah.  Your seal of approval means jack to me.

1111
01:33:46,471 --> 01:33:52,536
Their powers.  The horrors in our heads.  Ultron himself.  They all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash.

1112
01:33:52,549 --> 01:33:53,549
But with it on our side...

1113
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:55,868
Is it?  Are you?

1114
01:33:57,784 --> 01:33:58,784
On our side?

1115
01:34:00,556 --> 01:34:02,597
I don't think it's that simple.

1116
01:34:02,956 --> 01:34:05,541
Well it better get real simple real soon.

1117
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:11,593
I'm on the side of life.  Ultron isn't.  He will end it all.

1118
01:34:12,267 --> 01:34:14,444
- What's he waiting for?
- You.

1119
01:34:15,104 --> 01:34:16,865
- Where?
- Sokovia.

1120
01:34:16,941 --> 01:34:18,606
He's got Nat there too.

1121
01:34:20,411 --> 01:34:22,248
If we're wrong about you...

1122
01:34:24,246 --> 01:34:26,246
...if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...

1123
01:34:27,349 --> 01:34:29,205
What will you do?

1124
01:34:35,457 --> 01:34:40,598
I don't want to kill Ultron.  He's unique.  And he's in pain.

1125
01:34:43,182 --> 01:34:47,536
But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed.

1126
01:34:47,603 --> 01:34:52,503
Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the 'net, we have to act now.

1127
01:34:53,542 --> 01:34:57,191
And not one of us can do it without the others.

1128
01:34:59,682 --> 01:35:03,082
Maybe I am a monster.  I don't think I'd know if I were one.

1129
01:35:04,952 --> 01:35:08,353
I'm not what you are.  And not what you intended.

1130
01:35:10,561 --> 01:35:12,454
So there may be no way to make you trust me.

1131
01:35:12,528 --> 01:35:14,452
But we need to go.

1132
01:35:28,842 --> 01:35:29,842
Right.

1133
01:35:30,916 --> 01:35:31,916
Well done.

1134
01:35:33,913 --> 01:35:34,913
Three minutes.

1135
01:35:35,851 --> 01:35:37,075
Get what you need.

1136
01:35:53,268 --> 01:35:54,561
Good evening, boss.

1137
01:35:59,208 --> 01:36:02,689
No way we all get through this.  If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost.

1138
01:36:03,612 --> 01:36:06,357
- It's gonna be blood on the floor.
- I got no plans tomorrow night.

1139
01:36:06,483 --> 01:36:10,313
I get first crack at the big guy.  Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.

1140
01:36:11,051 --> 01:36:13,432
That's true, he hates you the most.

1141
01:36:17,758 --> 01:36:22,658
Ultron knows we're coming.  Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.

1142
01:36:23,053 --> 01:36:27,407
And that's what we signed up for.  But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.

1143
01:36:28,338 --> 01:36:31,938
So our priority is getting them out.

1144
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:35,733
We're under attack.  Clear the city, now.

1145
01:36:43,314 --> 01:36:44,607
Get off your asses.

1146
01:36:45,687 --> 01:36:50,569
All they want is to live their lives in peace.  And that's not going to happen today.

1147
01:36:51,225 --> 01:36:55,545
But we can do our best to protect them.  And we can get the job done.

1148
01:36:58,566 --> 01:37:01,083
We find out what Ultron's been building.

1149
01:37:01,689 --> 01:37:02,845
We find Romanoff,

1150
01:37:04,272 --> 01:37:05,565
and we clear the field.

1151
01:37:06,425 --> 01:37:08,398
Keep the fight between us.

1152
01:37:15,951 --> 01:37:20,224
Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world.

1153
01:37:21,056 --> 01:37:25,856
This isn't just about beating him.  It's about whether he's right.

1154
01:37:32,236 --> 01:37:35,060
Natasha!  Natasha!

1155
01:37:36,104 --> 01:37:37,104
Bruce?

1156
01:37:38,871 --> 01:37:39,871
You all right?

1157
01:37:40,108 --> 01:37:40,808
Yeah.

1158
01:37:40,877 --> 01:37:42,770
The team's in the city, it's about to light up.

1159
01:37:42,814 --> 01:37:44,747
I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?

1160
01:37:45,311 --> 01:37:47,411
Yeah.  I did.

1161
01:37:53,592 --> 01:37:54,585
So what's our play?

1162
01:37:54,925 --> 01:37:57,525
- I'm here to get you to safety.
- Job's not finished.

1163
01:37:58,010 --> 01:38:04,405
We get out with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians.  And you've done plenty.

1164
01:38:06,435 --> 01:38:07,659
Our fight is over.

1165
01:38:09,606 --> 01:38:11,035
So we just disappear?

1166
01:38:16,447 --> 01:38:17,447
Come on.

1167
01:38:22,023 --> 01:38:25,784
Your mind's in the church, boss.  I think he's waiting for you.

1168
01:38:30,627 --> 01:38:32,396
Come to confess your sins?

1169
01:38:33,028 --> 01:38:34,641
I don't know, how much time you got?

1170
01:38:34,642 --> 01:38:36,042
More than you.

1171
01:38:36,765 --> 01:38:40,065
Uhhh.  Have you been juicing?  On a Vibranium cocktail?

1172
01:38:41,034 --> 01:38:43,427
You're looking...I don't wanna say, puffy...

1173
01:38:43,502 --> 01:38:44,590
You're stalling to protect the people.

1174
01:38:45,521 --> 01:38:48,446
Well, that is the mission.  Did you forget?

1175
01:38:48,810 --> 01:38:52,119
I've moved beyond your mission.  I'm free.

1176
01:38:55,987 --> 01:38:56,987
What,

1177
01:38:57,716 --> 01:39:00,369
you think you're the only one stalling?

1178
01:39:01,187 --> 01:39:04,200
There's the rest of the Vibranium.  Function: still unclear.

1179
01:39:04,328 --> 01:39:06,097
This is how you end, Tony.

1180
01:39:06,764 --> 01:39:08,465
This is peace in my time.

1181
01:39:25,233 --> 01:39:26,233
Go!

1182
01:39:31,155 --> 01:39:32,155
Get off the bridge!

1183
01:39:37,294 --> 01:39:38,294
Run!

1184
01:39:40,027 --> 01:39:41,027
Ultron!

1185
01:39:47,434 --> 01:39:50,971
My Vision.  They really did take everything from me.

1186
01:39:51,439 --> 01:39:55,180
- You set the terms, you can change them.
- All right.

1187
01:39:56,877 --> 01:39:57,877
Ahhh!

1188
01:40:18,667 --> 01:40:20,028
FRIDAY!  The Vision?

1189
01:40:20,068 --> 01:40:24,678
Boss, it's working.  He's burning Ultron out of the 'net, he won't escape through there.

1190
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:29,398
You shut me out!

1191
01:40:30,712 --> 01:40:31,868
You think I care?

1192
01:40:33,795 --> 01:40:36,652
You take away my world, I take away yours.

1193
01:40:45,094 --> 01:40:47,087
Whoa!  What's this?

1194
01:40:52,067 --> 01:40:53,067
Run!

1195
01:41:02,309 --> 01:41:03,309
Get back, get back!

1196
01:41:22,333 --> 01:41:25,054
- FRIDAY?
- Sokovia's going for a ride.

1197
01:41:37,714 --> 01:41:44,411
Do you see?  The beauty of it.  The inevitability.

1198
01:41:44,588 --> 01:41:48,053
You rise, only to fall.

1199
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:58,719
You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure.

1200
01:42:01,536 --> 01:42:05,550
Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me.

1201
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:07,096
It means nothing.

1202
01:42:07,517 --> 01:42:13,283
When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal.

1203
01:42:18,152 --> 01:42:19,152
We gotta move.

1204
01:42:19,722 --> 01:42:20,931
You're not going to turn green?

1205
01:42:21,293 --> 01:42:24,226
I've got a compelling reason to not lose my cool.

1206
01:42:24,293 --> 01:42:25,293
I adore you.

1207
01:42:33,702 --> 01:42:35,403
But I need the other guy.

1208
01:42:40,775 --> 01:42:41,999
Let's finish the job.

1209
01:42:59,124 --> 01:43:02,369
- I really hope this makes us even.
- (grunt)

1210
01:43:02,665 --> 01:43:05,221
- Now go be a hero.
- Raaar!

1211
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:17,418
The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.

1212
01:43:17,448 --> 01:43:21,810
- If it drops?
- Right now the impact would kill thousands.  Once it gets high enough...

1213
01:43:21,811 --> 01:43:23,035
...global extinction.

1214
01:43:26,956 --> 01:43:29,269
That building's not clear, its tenth floor.

1215
01:43:34,281 --> 01:43:35,281
Hi.

1216
01:43:36,631 --> 01:43:38,528
Okay.  Get in the tub!

1217
01:43:45,774 --> 01:43:48,563
We got airborne, heading up to the bridge.

1218
01:43:49,753 --> 01:43:51,386
Cap, you got incoming.

1219
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,181
Incoming already came in.

1220
01:43:55,650 --> 01:43:58,647
Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely.

1221
01:43:58,922 --> 01:44:02,127
The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart.

1222
01:44:02,227 --> 01:44:07,645
You get hurt, hurt 'em back.  You get killed, walk it off.

1223
01:44:42,730 --> 01:44:43,730
Go, go, move!

1224
01:44:49,003 --> 01:44:50,803
How could I let this happen?

1225
01:44:50,972 --> 01:44:52,265
Hey, hey, you okay?

1226
01:44:52,707 --> 01:44:53,727
This is all our fault.

1227
01:44:53,740 --> 01:44:54,528
Hey, look at me.

1228
01:44:54,597 --> 01:44:56,998
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares.

1229
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:58,441
Are you up for this?

1230
01:44:58,647 --> 01:44:59,647
Are you?

1231
01:45:00,428 --> 01:45:04,033
Look, I just need to know, 'cause the city i-, is flying.

1232
01:45:04,254 --> 01:45:09,872
Okay, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow.

1233
01:45:09,878 --> 01:45:11,579
None of this makes sense.

1234
01:45:14,062 --> 01:45:17,735
But I'm going back out there because of my job.  Okay?

1235
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:19,841
And I can't do my job and babysit.

1236
01:45:20,333 --> 01:45:26,012
It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were.  If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill.

1237
01:45:26,038 --> 01:45:31,711
Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door,

1238
01:45:32,213 --> 01:45:33,506
you are an Avenger.

1239
01:45:38,221 --> 01:45:39,650
All right, good chat.

1240
01:45:42,757 --> 01:45:44,458
Yeah, the city is flying.

1241
01:46:18,393 --> 01:46:19,393
I got you!

1242
01:46:20,297 --> 01:46:21,385
Just look at me.

1243
01:46:27,768 --> 01:46:29,401
You can't save them all.

1244
01:46:30,814 --> 01:46:31,834
You'll never...

1245
01:46:32,497 --> 01:46:35,218
"You'll never" what?  You didn't finish!

1246
01:46:38,915 --> 01:46:40,480
What, were you napping?

1247
01:47:02,534 --> 01:47:03,834
Thor!

1248
01:47:05,207 --> 01:47:06,636
You are bothering me.

1249
01:47:16,019 --> 01:47:17,019
Ow!

1250
01:47:18,588 --> 01:47:19,588
Uh...

1251
01:47:42,944 --> 01:47:46,721
- All right, we're all clear here.
- We are not clear!  We are very not clear!

1252
01:47:49,516 --> 01:47:51,217
All right, coming to you.

1253
01:47:51,388 --> 01:47:52,544
Keep up, old man.

1254
01:47:55,992 --> 01:47:57,216
Nobody would know.

1255
01:47:58,108 --> 01:47:59,108
Nobody.

1256
01:48:00,659 --> 01:48:07,446
Yeah, last I saw him, and Ultron was sitting on him, uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard.  I miss him already.

1257
01:48:22,214 --> 01:48:24,034
Hold your fire!

1258
01:48:33,327 --> 01:48:34,327
Romanoff!

1259
01:48:34,863 --> 01:48:35,863
Thanks.

1260
01:48:45,407 --> 01:48:50,904
The anti-gravs are rigged to flip.  Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust.  The city's not coming down slow.

1261
01:48:50,944 --> 01:48:52,854
The spire's Vibranium.  If I get Thor to hit it...

1262
01:48:53,517 --> 01:48:56,417
It'll crack.  If that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.

1263
01:48:56,952 --> 01:49:00,158
What if we could cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.

1264
01:49:00,536 --> 01:49:02,509
That could vaporize the city.  And everyone on it.

1265
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:11,597
The next wave's gonna hit any minute.

1266
01:49:11,601 --> 01:49:13,202
What have you got, Stark?

1267
01:49:13,265 --> 01:49:16,938
Well, nothing great.  Maybe a way to blow up the city.

1268
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:19,662
That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.

1269
01:49:19,708 --> 01:49:22,533
I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.

1270
01:49:22,610 --> 01:49:24,671
Impact radius is getting bigger every second.

1271
01:49:24,710 --> 01:49:27,227
We're going to have to make a choice.

1272
01:49:27,451 --> 01:49:31,025
Cap, these people are going nowhere.  If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...

1273
01:49:31,786 --> 01:49:33,087
Not 'til everyone's safe.

1274
01:49:33,087 --> 01:49:35,887
Everyone up here versus everyone down there?  There's no math there.

1275
01:49:35,890 --> 01:49:37,890
I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.

1276
01:49:38,194 --> 01:49:40,167
I didn't say we should leave.

1277
01:49:41,859 --> 01:49:43,492
There's worse ways to go.

1278
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:51,597
Where else am I gonna get a view like this?

1279
01:49:52,891 --> 01:49:57,591
Glad you like the view, Romanoff.  It's about to get better.

1280
01:50:20,902 --> 01:50:27,155
Nice, right?  I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends.  She's dusty, but she'll do.

1281
01:50:27,172 --> 01:50:28,773
Fury, you son of a bitch.

1282
01:50:28,773 --> 01:50:31,234
Oooh!  You kiss your mother with that mouth?

1283
01:50:31,514 --> 01:50:33,491
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

1284
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:39,980
Lifeboats secure to deploy.  Disengage in 3, 2...take 'em out.

1285
01:50:49,229 --> 01:50:50,249
This is SHIELD?

1286
01:50:51,331 --> 01:50:53,848
This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.

1287
01:50:55,671 --> 01:50:56,964
This is not so bad.

1288
01:51:00,341 --> 01:51:01,341
Let's load 'em up.

1289
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:10,266
Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.

1290
01:51:10,662 --> 01:51:12,091
Show 'em what we got.

1291
01:51:12,485 --> 01:51:13,485
You're up.

1292
01:51:19,127 --> 01:51:21,848
Yes!  Now this is gonna be a good story.

1293
01:51:24,734 --> 01:51:26,707
Yup.  If you live to tell it.

1294
01:51:27,036 --> 01:51:28,977
You think I can't hold my own?

1295
01:51:29,050 --> 01:51:31,171
We get through this, I'll hold your own.

1296
01:51:31,207 --> 01:51:32,908
You had to make it weird.

1297
01:51:36,847 --> 01:51:39,247
Donovan!  I got about 50 to 100 more coming in after this group.

1298
01:51:41,318 --> 01:51:42,806
All right, let's go!

1299
01:51:56,968 --> 01:51:58,697
Here we go, here we go, let's move.

1300
01:51:58,699 --> 01:51:59,699
Let's go everyone!

1301
01:52:02,628 --> 01:52:09,363
Number six boat is topped and locked.  Or, uh, or stocked, topped, it...it's uh, full of people.

1302
01:52:11,010 --> 01:52:12,010
Incoming!

1303
01:52:14,824 --> 01:52:15,824
Oh, God!

1304
01:52:26,694 --> 01:52:28,191
You think you're saving anyone?

1305
01:52:29,795 --> 01:52:35,383
I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead.  Even you can't stop that.

1306
01:52:35,603 --> 01:52:44,302
I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say!  Are you ready?

1307
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:52,925
It's terribly well balanced.

1308
01:52:52,973 --> 01:52:57,191
Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.

1309
01:52:57,504 --> 01:53:00,225
I got it!  Create a heat seal.  I can...

1310
01:53:01,786 --> 01:53:05,936
- I can supercharge the spire from below.
- Running numbers.

1311
01:53:15,210 --> 01:53:18,631
- A heat seal could work with enough power.
- Thor, I got a plan!

1312
01:53:18,679 --> 01:53:21,544
We're out of time.  They're coming for the core.

1313
01:53:21,549 --> 01:53:24,082
- Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.
- On it.

1314
01:53:24,262 --> 01:53:26,711
Avengers, time to work for a living.

1315
01:53:35,631 --> 01:53:37,131
- You good?
- Yeah.

1316
01:53:37,853 --> 01:53:38,853
Romanoff?

1317
01:53:39,335 --> 01:53:42,076
You and Banner better not be playing hide the zucchini.

1318
01:53:42,338 --> 01:53:45,038
Relax, shellhead.  Not all of us can fly.

1319
01:53:50,478 --> 01:53:52,567
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.

1320
01:53:52,648 --> 01:53:54,748
If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose.

1321
01:53:59,219 --> 01:54:00,619
Is that the best you can do?

1322
01:54:10,666 --> 01:54:11,686
You had to ask.

1323
01:54:12,498 --> 01:54:14,267
This is the best I can do.

1324
01:54:15,336 --> 01:54:19,486
This is exactly what I wanted.  All of you against all of me.

1325
01:54:20,509 --> 01:54:23,026
How can you possibly hope to stop me?

1326
01:54:24,376 --> 01:54:27,721
Like the old man said.  Together.

1327
01:54:28,082 --> 01:54:29,682
Raaarrrr!!!

1328
01:55:55,238 --> 01:55:58,838
Uhh!  You know, with the benefit of hindsight....

1329
01:56:03,434 --> 01:56:04,434
Rarrrr!

1330
01:56:08,118 --> 01:56:09,859
They'll try to leave the city.

1331
01:56:09,885 --> 01:56:11,794
We can't let 'em, not even one.  Rhodey!

1332
01:56:11,812 --> 01:56:14,312
I'm on it.  Oh no, I didn't say you could leave.

1333
01:56:14,989 --> 01:56:16,758
War Machine, comin' at you, right...

1334
01:56:23,526 --> 01:56:24,526
Okay, what?

1335
01:56:24,831 --> 01:56:28,455
We gotta move out.  Even I can tell the air is getting thin.  You guys get to the boats...

1336
01:56:28,524 --> 01:56:30,524
I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you.

1337
01:56:30,636 --> 01:56:31,897
What about the core?

1338
01:56:32,206 --> 01:56:36,494
I'll protect it.  It's my job.

1339
01:56:37,378 --> 01:56:38,378
Nat.

1340
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:47,670
- Get the people on the boats.
- I'm not going to leave you.
- I can handle these.

1341
01:56:49,521 --> 01:56:51,746
Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.

1342
01:56:51,758 --> 01:56:53,278
- Mmm.
- You understand?

1343
01:56:55,326 --> 01:56:57,447
You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.

1344
01:56:57,723 --> 01:56:58,723
Heh. Go.

1345
01:57:00,366 --> 01:57:06,556
- Boss, power levels are way below...
- Re-route everything.  We've got one shot at this.

1346
01:57:08,608 --> 01:57:11,261
I know what I need to do.  The dining room!

1347
01:57:11,946 --> 01:57:16,912
If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh.

1348
01:57:16,998 --> 01:57:19,659
Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?

1349
01:57:19,806 --> 01:57:21,891
You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.

1350
01:57:21,988 --> 01:57:23,961
Noone eats in a dining room.

1351
01:57:26,426 --> 01:57:27,426
Raarrrr!

1352
01:57:28,663 --> 01:57:30,568
We don't have a lot of time.

1353
01:57:30,596 --> 01:57:32,365
So get your ass on a boat.

1354
01:57:45,081 --> 01:57:46,081
Hey big guy.

1355
01:57:48,284 --> 01:57:49,849
Sun's getting real low.

1356
01:57:50,859 --> 01:57:54,308
You'll see, It'll be okay. ...

1357
01:57:56,323 --> 01:57:57,216
Secure your gear...

1358
01:57:57,492 --> 01:57:58,492
Kostya!?

1359
01:57:59,926 --> 01:58:00,926
We were in the market.

1360
01:58:01,695 --> 01:58:04,488
Kostya?

1361
01:58:17,079 --> 01:58:19,272
Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.

1362
01:58:19,313 --> 01:58:21,014
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah.

1363
01:58:21,417 --> 01:58:22,417
Everyone else is on the carrier.

1364
01:58:22,448 --> 01:58:27,513
- Y'know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.
- Maybe not.

1365
01:58:46,575 --> 01:58:52,321
(singing) I have no strings, so I have fun.  I'm not tied up to anyone.

1366
01:58:54,418 --> 01:58:55,711
C'mon, I'll help you up.

1367
01:59:28,324 --> 01:59:30,025
You didn't see that coming.

1368
02:00:26,271 --> 02:00:27,768
Oh, for god's sake...!

1369
02:00:45,161 --> 02:00:46,461
Kostya!

1370
02:00:58,338 --> 02:00:59,562
No, no.  I'm fine.

1371
02:01:02,845 --> 02:01:04,274
But it's been a long day.

1372
02:01:19,395 --> 02:01:20,395
Wanda.

1373
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:23,373
If you stay here, you'll die.

1374
02:01:25,699 --> 02:01:26,899
I just did.

1375
02:01:27,970 --> 02:01:29,399
Do you know how it felt?

1376
02:01:43,947 --> 02:01:45,371
It felt like that.

1377
02:02:20,858 --> 02:02:22,314
Thor, on my mark.

1378
02:02:38,171 --> 02:02:39,371
Now!

1379
02:03:06,551 --> 02:03:07,751
Hey big guy.

1380
02:03:08,770 --> 02:03:09,970
We did it.

1381
02:03:10,235 --> 02:03:11,596
The job's finished.

1382
02:03:12,472 --> 02:03:15,272
Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay?

1383
02:03:19,648 --> 02:03:24,217
We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out.

1384
02:03:24,649 --> 02:03:25,669
I need you t...

1385
02:03:57,388 --> 02:03:58,388
Oh, dear.

1386
02:04:10,496 --> 02:04:11,496
You're afraid.

1387
02:04:12,630 --> 02:04:15,330
- Of you?
- Of death.

1388
02:04:15,970 --> 02:04:17,331
You're the last one.

1389
02:04:18,364 --> 02:04:20,813
You were supposed to be the last.

1390
02:04:20,838 --> 02:04:24,839
Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave.

1391
02:04:25,978 --> 02:04:28,495
I suppose we're both disappointments.

1392
02:04:28,547 --> 02:04:31,747
Ha ha ha ha.  I suppose we are.

1393
02:04:32,688 --> 02:04:33,788
Humans are odd.

1394
02:04:35,887 --> 02:04:39,492
They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and

1395
02:04:41,225 --> 02:04:43,198
try to control what won't be.

1396
02:04:44,232 --> 02:04:46,749
But there is grace in their failings.

1397
02:04:47,119 --> 02:04:48,752
I think you missed that.

1398
02:04:49,735 --> 02:04:50,755
They're doomed.

1399
02:04:51,839 --> 02:04:52,839
Yes.

1400
02:04:56,542 --> 02:04:59,747
But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.

1401
02:05:01,799 --> 02:05:04,112
It's a privilege to be among them.

1402
02:05:04,449 --> 02:05:06,082
You're unbearably naive.

1403
02:05:07,321 --> 02:05:08,358
Well,

1404
02:05:10,022 --> 02:05:11,451
I was born yesterday.

1405
02:06:06,854 --> 02:06:07,854
(chatter)

1406
02:06:24,936 --> 02:06:26,365
Say hi to Auntie Nat.

1407
02:06:28,133 --> 02:06:29,133
Fat.

1408
02:06:30,207 --> 02:06:34,697
One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea,

1409
02:06:36,744 --> 02:06:42,666
could be the Quinjet.  But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.

1410
02:06:42,683 --> 02:06:43,683
Right.

1411
02:06:44,884 --> 02:06:47,333
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

1412
02:06:48,022 --> 02:06:49,519
He'll send a postcard.

1413
02:06:50,458 --> 02:06:51,751
"Wish you were here."

1414
02:06:54,030 --> 02:06:56,887
You sent me to recruit him, way back when.

1415
02:06:58,330 --> 02:07:01,255
Did you know then what was going to happen?

1416
02:07:03,673 --> 02:07:08,503
You never know.  You hope for the best and make do with what you get.

1417
02:07:10,109 --> 02:07:11,402
I got a great team.

1418
02:07:12,446 --> 02:07:13,943
Nothing lasts forever.

1419
02:07:15,048 --> 02:07:20,558
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.  No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes 'round.

1420
02:07:24,923 --> 02:07:27,069
- The rules have changed.
- We're dealing with something new.

1421
02:07:27,161 --> 02:07:30,217
- Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence.
- A machine.

1422
02:07:30,697 --> 02:07:33,499
- So it doesn't count.
- No.  It's not, like, a person lifting the hammer.

1423
02:07:33,597 --> 02:07:36,197
- Right.  Different rules for us.
- Nice guy.  But artificial.
- Thank you.

1424
02:07:36,371 --> 02:07:39,908
If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone.

1425
02:07:40,039 --> 02:07:41,808
It's safe with the Vision.

1426
02:07:42,041 --> 02:07:44,762
And these days, safe is in short supply.

1427
02:07:47,083 --> 02:07:51,246
- But if you put the hammer in an elevator...
- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.

1428
02:07:51,286 --> 02:07:52,571
I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.

1429
02:07:52,651 --> 02:07:54,216
Not if you don't leave.

1430
02:07:54,454 --> 02:07:55,610
I have no choice.

1431
02:07:56,353 --> 02:08:02,536
The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years.  It's not a coincidence.

1432
02:08:03,232 --> 02:08:06,132
Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us.

1433
02:08:06,330 --> 02:08:09,787
- Once all these pieces are in position...
- Triple Yahtzee?

1434
02:08:09,838 --> 02:08:11,527
You think you can find out what's coming?

1435
02:08:11,574 --> 02:08:12,574
I do.

1436
02:08:13,408 --> 02:08:17,354
Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained.

1437
02:08:24,978 --> 02:08:27,971
That man has no regard for lawn maintenance.

1438
02:08:30,358 --> 02:08:31,895
I'm gonna miss him though.

1439
02:08:31,994 --> 02:08:36,484
And you're gonna miss me.  There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

1440
02:08:36,530 --> 02:08:38,027
I will miss you, Tony.

1441
02:08:38,833 --> 02:08:41,622
Yeah?  Well, it's time for me to tap out.

1442
02:08:43,137 --> 02:08:48,804
Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm.  Hope nobody blows it up.

1443
02:08:48,874 --> 02:08:49,762
The simple life.

1444
02:08:49,808 --> 02:08:50,964
You'll get there one day.

1445
02:08:51,647 --> 02:08:59,747
I don't know.  Family, stability.  The guy who wanted all that went in the ice 75 years ago.

1446
02:09:01,057 --> 02:09:03,098
I think someone else came out.

1447
02:09:07,261 --> 02:09:08,261
You all right?

1448
02:09:09,762 --> 02:09:10,762
I'm home.

1449
02:09:19,909 --> 02:09:21,822
You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work?

1450
02:09:21,878 --> 02:09:24,531
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

1451
02:09:24,579 --> 02:09:27,997
I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes.

1452
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,020
How do we look?

1453
02:09:29,083 --> 02:09:31,871
- Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.
- We've got some hitters.

1454
02:09:32,850 --> 02:09:37,340
- They're good.  They're not a team.
- Let's beat 'em into shape.

1455
02:09:55,571 --> 02:09:57,371
Avengers...!

1456
02:09:57,585 --> 02:10:02,585
SPOILER COMING UP -

1457
02:10:02,622 --> 02:10:07,622
MID-CREDIT STINGER SCENE (missing from this video) -

1458
02:10:07,658 --> 02:10:14,658
A gold glove is shown stored inside a vault; the door to the vault opens.

1459
02:10:14,726 --> 02:10:21,726
Thanos puts his left hand into the gauntlet and raises it with a fist.

1460
02:10:21,802 --> 02:10:28,802
He says, "Fine.  I'll do it myself."

1461
02:10:28,874 --> 02:10:42,874
The gauntlet has 6 empty receptacles (5 knuckles & 1 back of the hand), presumably for Infinity Stones to be placed into in future movies.
