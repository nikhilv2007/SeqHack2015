The Basics

The Graph API is named after the idea of a 'social graph' - a representation of the information on Facebook composed of:

nodes - basically "things" such as a User, a Photo, a Page, a Comment.
edges - the connections between those "things", such as a Page's Photos, or a Photo's Comments
fields - info about those "things", such as the birthday of a User, or the name of a Page
The Graph API is HTTP based, so it works with any language that has an HTTP library, such as cURL, urllib. We'll explain a bit more about what you can do with this in the section below, but it means you can also use the Graph API directly in your browser, for example a Graph API request is equivalent to:


The Graph API has multiple versions available to access at any one time. Each version contains a set of core fields and edge operations. We guarantee that those core APIs will be available and un-modified in that version for at least 2 years from release. The platform changelog can tell you which versions are currently available.

Everything outside of these core APIs are called extended APIs. These APIs are still accessed through versioned paths, but they can potentially be modified or removed at any time, subject to 90-day migrations that would be announced on our platform roadmap. Alternatively they may simply be included in the next available API version.

You can read more about the intent of versioning in our guide, but here we'll explain how you make a call to a specific version of the Graph API.

It's really simple - just pre-pend the version identifier to the start of the request path. For example, here's a call to v2.2:

The easiest way to understand the Graph API is to use it with the Graph API Explorer, a low-level tool you can use to query, add and remove data. It's a very handy resource to have at your fingertips while you integrate with Facebook.
